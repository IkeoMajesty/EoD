{"_id":"NaBaOPxnbOdFXbjV","name":"LOOKING AROUND  THE GRAVEYARD","content":"<p>The cemetery is reasonably well tended, although the vegetation is quite abundant, with lots of tall bushes and ancient trees dotting the spaces between the gravestones and tombs. It’s clear the cemetery has been here for many years. As the investigator explores the grounds, they spot a gardener who is digging out weeds at the far side of the cemetery. When the gardener hears the investigator’s approach, he turns and waves a hello.</p>\n<p>Melodias Jefferson is the caretaker of the cemetery; he has worked here for over 20 years. If he is approached, ask the investigator to make a Charm or Persuade roll to see if Jefferson is prepared to talk. If the roll is failed, the caretaker is unimpressed and says he is too busy to stand and chat. </p>\n<p>Keeper note: if the player failed the Charm or Persuade roll, ask if they want to persist in their efforts to engage the caretaker in conversation. If they choose to do so, they may attempt a pushed roll by continuing to appeal to Jefferson in some way (they may change their approach and use an alternate method (skill) at this point). Roleplay the interaction between Jefferson and the investigator; based on the way the roleplay goes, choose one of the following options:<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the investigator is trying to win Jefferson round with friendliness or compliments, use the Charm skill.</li>\n<li>If the investigator is using rational arguments—perhaps using some sort of authority—use the Persuade skill.</li>\n<li>If the investigator is being aggressive towards Jefferson, use the Intimidate skill.</li>\n<li>If the investigator is trying to con or fool Jefferson, use the Fast Talk skill.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As this is a pushed roll, depending on their course of action, you should decide on what could happen (a consequence) if they fail this second attempt. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the investigator is using Intimidate, the consequence might be that Jefferson grows annoyed and storms off in a huff, or calls their bluff by waving a dangerous-looking shovel in their direction and asking them to leave. </li>\n<li>If the investigator is using Charm or Persuade, the consequence might be that Jefferson takes offence and loudly screams at them to leave the cemetery at once.</li>\n<li>If Fast Talk is used, the consequence of failure could be Jefferson picking up a fistful of soil and throwing it at the investigator with a “Get out of here, you scoundrel!” </li>\n<li>Whatever the consequence of failure, ensure that it escalates beyond Jefferson refusing to talk to them—running them out of the cemetery at rudely worded questions, for instance. If the situation escalates, Jefferson runs off shouting “Police!Police!” While no police officer is nearby, the investigator doesn’t know that, so the threat of arrest appears real. In any case, Jefferson has taken a dislike to the investigator and any attempt to engage him later in conversation is going to be more difficult, requiring a Hard level of success on any future skill rolls to communicate with him.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the original or pushed roll is successful, Jefferson is happy to talk and recalls seeing Douglas Kimball regularly in the graveyard and that, nowadays, he misses seeing him about, as he would often spend time in conversation with him. The two would talk about all manner of topics, from the weather to politics, and Jefferson enjoyed hearing Kimball’s stories about foreign lands. The caretaker also points out Kimball’s favorite tombstone, the one that he used to always sit on while reading his books. </p>\n<p>Jefferson talks for a few minutes but seems anxious to get back to his work. If asked about strange events in the graveyard or suspicious folk loitering about, he clams up and refuses to say more, saying he has lots to do and must depart. Ask the investigator to make a Psychology roll to judge the caretaker’s state of mind. If successful, it appears that the caretaker is hiding something and knows more than he is saying. Otherwise, the investigator does not pick up on this insight.</p>\n<p>While talking to Jefferson, ask the investigator to make a <strong>Spot Hidden</strong> roll. If successful, they notice a bottle peeking out of Jefferson’s coat pocket. Assuming there is alcohol in the bottle (there is), the investigator may try to blackmail or bribe additional information out of the caretaker. Blackmailing Jefferson requires either a successful <strong>Intimidate </strong>or Hard <strong>Persuade</strong> roll (see note below). Or the investigator could keep quiet for now and, perhaps, try to bribe Jefferson with alcohol later—if they can obtain some booze from town.</p>\n<p>In the 1920s, Prohibition was enforced across America, meaning that alcohol was illegal. To find and buy booze during Prohibition, a player must roll their investigator’s <strong>Know </strong>value (which is equal to their Education (<strong>EDU</strong>) characteristic). If successful, a pint of liquor may be obtained for $2 in town. If the roll is failed, ask the investigator to make a Luck roll to avoid arrest; a roll of 96–00 results in automatic arrest. If taken by the police, the investigator is kept in a cell overnight, given a stern talking to about mending their ways, and released without charge the following morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: the Intimidate roll is set at Regular difficulty (the default for all rolls); however, using Persuade requires a Hard roll (half value) as, in this situation, it’s harder to reason with Jefferson than just simply threatening him.</p>\n<p>If blackmail (<strong>Intimidate </strong>or Hard <strong>Persuade </strong>roll) or bribery (no roll, just the gifting of some alcohol) succeeds, Jefferson admits to recently seeing a dark figure in the cemetery late at night near the same tombstone that Douglas Kimball used to sit on, but he was too afraid to investigate, believing it was Kimball’s ghost.

{"_id":"QNdjcN00Dz4EGwrd","name":"WATCHING THE   HOUSE OR CEMETERY","content":"<p>If a watch of the house and/or cemetery is set up, then each night a <strong>Luck </strong>roll should be attempted for the investigator; the first night the roll is successful, a figure is seen leaving the cemetery grounds and heading towards the house, whereupon it enters through one of the study’s windows. </p>\n<p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: if the investigator somehow bolstered the window locks in the study, the figure rams its shoulder against the window, smashing the wood and breaking the pane. Such a noise might alert the investigator if they are asleep in the house.</p>\n<p>Presuming the investigator waits and watches, a few minutes later, the figure reemerges, laden with books, and heads back into the cemetery. If the investigator confronts the figure, chases it, or tries to attack it, it tries to flee into the cemetery, carrying the books. A number of outcomes or situations may now arise, dependent on what the investigator does. The following describes how some of the options might play out; the Keeper should use the most appropriate version of events (possibly using the information from one or more of the following outcomes and adjusting it to suit what is happening in your game). In summary, the following sections cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the investigator tries to attack the figure.</li>\n<li>If the investigator manages to kill or incapacitate the figure.</li>\n<li>If the investigator tries to speak to the figure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If the Investigator Tries to Attack the Figure</strong></p>\n<p>If the investigator tries to hit the figure (actually Douglas Kimball, but don’t tell the player this yet), ask for a<strong> Fighting (Brawl)</strong> roll to see if the attack connects. The Keeper should roll for the figure’s <strong>Dodge </strong>skill to see if it evades the attack. Douglas Kimball has Dodge 30% (15/6). Both the Keeper (rolling for Douglas) and the player roll percentage dice (1D100), comparing Douglas’ Dodge result to the investigator’s Brawl result. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the investigator gets a higher level of success than Douglas, they win the combat and the investigator’s player gets to roll 1D3 to determine the attack’s damage, which is deducted from Douglas Kimball’s hit points. If struck in this manner, the books he is holding fall to the floor. </li>\n<li>If the investigator’s result is a lower level of success or a failure, or equal to Douglas’ result, the attack has failed and causes no damage. Douglas managed to evade the blow and makes a dash for the cemetery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, if the investigator is using a gun, the attack roll uses the<strong> Firearms (Handgun)</strong> skill instead; roll for Douglas Kimball’s Dodge (Dive for Cover), but in this situation, if the Dodge roll is successful, the investigator suffers a penalty die to their Firearms skill roll (thus, roll for the Dodge before the player makes the investigator’s attack roll). Note that the two rolls (Dodge and Firearms) are not compared—the Dodge is rolled first, and only if that roll is successful is a penalty die applied to the opponent’s Firearms roll. If the investigator managed to shoot the figure, then work out the damage by rolling the appropriate die for the gun carried (1D10 for a handgun).</p>\n<p><strong>Keeper note: </strong>if you need to refresh your memory about the combat rules, refer to page 18 of<strong> Book Two</strong>. Note that in this scene we are ignoring the DEX ordering for who goes first in combat; we are assuming the investigator acts first this time.</p>\n<p>If somehow unable to get away, the figure (Douglas Kimball) returns the attack after dropping the books. This time, Douglas Kimball is initiating the attack, rolling against his Claws skill of 50% (25/10); the investigator must choose to either attempt to Dodge or Fight Back against the attack. </p>\n<p>Both Douglas and the investigator roll percentage dice (1D100) and compare their levels of success:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the investigator is Fighting Back, they roll against their <strong>Fighting (Brawl)</strong> skill and need to achieve a higher level of success than Douglas’ result to avoid getting hurt.</li>\n<li>If the investigator is Dodging, they roll against their <strong>Dodge </strong>skill and succeed if they equal or achieve a higher level of success than Douglas’ result.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the investigator is hit, deduct 1D6 hit points of damage and tell the player that their investigator has been thrown to the floor, giving the figure time to gather up the dropped books and run into the cemetery.</p>\n<p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: Douglas Kimball only fights to drive off or knock down his assailant. He then flees with his precious burden into the cemetery. Note that Douglas Kimball has a total of 12 hit points. Any damage suffered is deducted from this total. If it falls to zero (say, from two hits from a handgun) then Douglas Kimball is dead (see next section). If the investigator is only using fisticuffs, then Kimball is knocked unconscious if he suffers the loss of half (6) his hit points (see next section). </p>\n<p><strong>If the Investigator Manages to Kill or Incapacitate the Figure</strong></p>\n<p>If the investigator manages to kill or incapacitate (knock unconscious) the figure, they get a closer look at its face; it turns out to be a foul-looking humanoid, naked but covered in caked mud and mold, whose face is bestial, with large canine teeth and a rudimentary canine-like snout in place of a human nose. The most chilling thing, however, is that its face has an uncanny resemblance to Douglas Kimball. Due to this shocking revelation, ask the player to make two <strong>Sanity </strong>rolls (rolling 1D100 twice and comparing both results to the investigator’s Sanity value).</p>\n<p><strong>For the first roll</strong>: if successful (a roll equal to or below the investigator’s Sanity value), they don’t lose any Sanity points; if failed (a roll above the investigator’s Sanity value), they lose 1D6 Sanity points and make one involuntary action of the Keeper’s choice, perhaps dropping whatever they are holding (like a weapon or flashlight) or screaming. This first Sanity roll is for the shock and horror of meeting a ghoul. </p>\n<p><strong>For the second roll</strong>: if successful, they lose 1 Sanity point; if failed, they lose 1D4 Sanity points and also make one involuntary action, such as screaming. This second roll is for realizing the ghoul is the missing Douglas Kimball!</p>\n<p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: if an investigator loses 5 or more Sanity points in one instance, the player should make an <strong>INT </strong>roll. If the INT roll is passed, the investigator has understood the full implications of the situation and is driven temporarily insane—the Keeper would now normally refer to the <strong>Bouts of Madness Table</strong> (<strong>Book Two</strong>, page 17); in this case, assume the investigator suffers a fit of screaming for 1D10 rounds. If the INT roll is failed, the character is shaken but remains sane.</p>\n<p>As the investigator stands over the dead or unconscious form of Douglas Kimball, shuffling sounds can be heard coming from all round. Ask for another <strong>Sanity </strong>roll, as dozens of ghouls loom out of the darkness towards the investigator.</p>\n<p><strong>If the Sanity roll is failed</strong>: the investigator loses 6 points of Sanity. As this is more than 5 points lost in one instance, they must make an <strong>INT </strong>roll. If failed, they are shaken but fine; otherwise, they are temporarily insane and fall to the ground in a dead faint. Some time later, they wake up in the Arnoldsburg Sanitarium. There was no trace of a ghoul or Douglas Kimball when the investigator’s unconscious body was found. Apparently, Thomas Kimball heard a scream and found the investigator, who was incoherent and ranting about monsters in the graveyard. Thus, an ambulance was called and the investigator has enjoyed a week in the care of the Sanitarium. Fortunately, the investigator’s efforts must have found success, as no one has returned to break into Mr. Kimball’s home and all has been quiet ever since. With this, the scenario has ended. Thomas feels the investigator must have driven off the burglar and is happy to pay the fee for a job well done. It is up to the player whether Thomas is told the truth about his missing uncle. Refer to the Conclusion to bring the game to a close.</p>\n<p><strong>If the Sanity roll is successful</strong>: ask the player what they want to do—a pack of ghouls is advancing towards them. If they try to fight or shoot, the ghouls rapidly overpower the investigator—even if the investigator successfully hits some of the ghouls, there are just too many of them. The investigator is taken back to their burrows by the ghouls, never to be seen again. If the investigator flees, the ghouls do not follow and, instead, take Douglas Kimball (whether dead or unconscious) and return to the cemetery. Should the investigator come back the next morning to look for the ghouls and Douglas Kimball, all signs of them are gone. The ghouls have moved on and will not return. Thomas Kimball will not be bothered again. This also leads to the end of the scenario, with the same results as outlined above. Refer to the <strong>Conclusion </strong>to close the game.</p>\n<p><strong>If the Investigator Tries to Speak to the Figure</strong></p>\n<p>Simply calling out to the figure elicits little response; perhaps, at most, a momentary turn of the head towards the investigator. The figure continues to make its way into the cemetery. If the investigator thinks to call out “Douglas Kimball,” the figure stops for a brief moment but then heads slowly into the cemetery, as if it is expecting to be followed by the investigator. Once inside, it makes its way to Douglas Kimball’s favorite tombstone and sits down. When the investigator approaches, the figure speaks and says, “Hello.”</p>\n<p>The investigator, on seeing and realizing that the ghoul-like figure is actually Douglas Kimball must succeed in a <strong>Sanity </strong>roll or lose 1D4 Sanity points and let out a scream (involuntary action). Douglas Kimball the ghoul raises an eyebrow at the investigator and waits for them to gather themselves and calm down.</p>\n<p>Unless the investigator does something to annoy Douglas (such as attempting to hit or shoot him; if so, refer to <strong>If the Investigator Tries to Attack the Figure</strong>), he will now answer any questions if asked in a civilized manner. Douglas says that he was just too tired of his mundane existence among humans. The only thing he wanted from life was to be left alone, able to read whenever he liked, but other humans kept making demands on him. Living as a ghoul, his life is great. He does not need money. He does not have to dress for dinner. He does not have to meet people, except at mealtimes. He can read whenever he wants, day or night. But the other ghouls are shutting down this entrance, so he had one last night to try and get more of his books before he and they left for good. There is so much to see and experience in the world below that he is planning to write his own book about his experiences.</p>\n<p>He asks the investigator not to reveal to his nephew that he is still alive (in a manner of speaking). He then creeps inside the mausoleum and descends into the tunnel. His final action is to pull a large stone slab over the entrance to seal it behind him. If the investigator has been beguiled by the wonders of life as a ghoul or, otherwise, wants to go with Douglas, it can happen, but the investigator will not be heard from again. If left alone to depart, Douglas Kimball and the ghouls close in the entrance to their tunnels and never return. </p>\n<p>This conversation supplies the investigator with the truth about the situation, but it is an unpleasant truth, which causes the loss of 1D4 Sanity points to hear. On the bright side, the truth also increases the investigator’s knowledge, so they gain +3 percentile points in the Cthulhu Mythos skill.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xDrgVeFYRFSwH5iA":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"ce9yhYQsREZR2cKe","name":"KEEPER INFORMATION: BACKGROUND","content":"<p>Douglas Kimball lived in a small house at 218, Aylesbury Street in Arnoldsburg, Michigan, for most of his life. A solitary, middle-aged man, he lived only for his books and reading. He read in his study. He read in bed. He read the Bible in church. And, for reasons no one can quite explain, he took to reading in the graveyard near his home.</p>\n<p>For hours at a time he would sit on one particular low tomb and read. One night, darkness caught him still reading. The bright, full moon rose and Douglas noticed a most singular occurrence. A doorway, built into a mausoleum, creaked open, and a strange entity stuck its head out and “meeped” softly.</p>\n<p>A most bizarre friendship began; a friendship that lasted for five years until, one night, Douglas followed his new friend into the twilight world of the ghouls, where he has dwelt, quite contented, ever since.</p>\n<p>A year passed, and Douglas Kimball acquired new living habits, a slightly altered appearance, and unusual dietary tastes. He began to do his reading at night. But one cannot read the same books forever. One evening, he broke into his old house, now owned by his nephew, and retrieved some of his beloved books.</p>\n<p>Now, during the night, Douglas sits upon his small, low tomb and reads peacefully. But these books will last him just so long. Even now, he plans to retrieve more of them.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xDrgVeFYRFSwH5iA":3},"flags":{}}

A five-minute walk around the area finds a few homes but the neighbors know little and haven’t seen any suspicious behavior. If Douglas Kimball’s name is mentioned, one neighbor remembers him as a kindly man.</p>\n<p>While walking around, the investigator spots an elderly lady passing by. If the investigator can succeed with an <strong>APP </strong>(Appearance) or <strong>Credit Rating</strong> roll, the lady is happy to stop and talk; otherwise, she doesn’t like the look of the investigator and hurries off, avoiding them. </p>\n<p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> the old lady (Mrs. Lila O’Dell) believes looks matter, so rolling against the investigator’s Appearance (APP) or their Credit Rating determines whether they are presentable enough for the old lady. The player can choose whichever of the two rolls to make (whichever one they have the higher value in) but they only get to make one roll. Ask the player to roll percentage dice (1D100) and compare the result with their investigator’s APP or Credit Rating, as appropriate. If the roll is equal to or lower than the skill, the investigator has succeeded in winning Mrs. O’Dell’s attention. </p>\n<p>If the roll is successful, Mrs. O’Dell says she has lived in the area for a long time and remembers seeing Douglas Kimball back when he lived in the house by the cemetery. She recalls that most days he could be seen walking over to the cemetery with a book under his arm. “Forever reading he was.” Mrs. O’Dell hasn’t seen Mr. Kimball for some years. “Didn’t he pass away?” She says, adding, “I believe his nephew inherited the house.” After this brief conversation, Mrs. O’Dell bids them good day and wanders off.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xDrgVeFYRFSwH5iA":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"ewmClf0nu6moaKPJ","name":"TALKING TO THE POLICE","content":"<p>Wandering over to the police station allows the investigator to ask if anyone else in the neighborhood has recently suffered a break-in, or whether any suspicious types have been spotted or arrested in the area. Finding out such information can depend on just who the investigator is, as someone like a private detective or journalist stands a far better chance of having a productive conversation with the desk officer than a drifter or bumbling professor unacquainted with the law. Thus, consider the investigator’s occupation and whether they would have had previous “professional” dealings with the police. If the answer is yes, then the following information is free (no roll required); otherwise, the investigator must succeed in either a <strong>Law</strong>, <strong>Charm</strong>, or <strong>Persuade </strong>roll to get the busy desk officer to talk to them. (If the roll is failed, the officer is too busy and tries to brush them off, telling them to come back tomorrow.) Relate the following pieces of information, dependent on what the investigator is asking about:</p>\n<p><em><sup>About Burglaries in the Area</sup></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There have been no reported break-ins for some time (the last burglary dates a year back, and the culprit was arrested for that crime). </li>\n<li>The man arrested ( Jake “Six Fingers” Thompson) was a known cat burglar and remains in prison serving out his sentence.</li>\n<li>There have been no reports of any unusual or odd-looking people in recent days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><sup>Asking About the Cemetery</sup></em></p>\n<p>The cemetery is in a quiet neighborhood and nothing out of the ordinary has recently been reported. Some time back, perhaps six or seven years ago, there were reports of some strange noises coming from the cemetery late at night. Patrols made a point of passing by for a few weeks but nothing was seen or heard. “It was as quiet as a grave!” the officer jokes.</p>\n<p><em><sup>About Thomas Kimball’s Missing Uncle Douglas </sup></em></p>\n<p>The desk officer remembers that a missing person report was filled out for Douglas Kimball, and his photograph was circulated far and wide, but the man was never found. </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xDrgVeFYRFSwH5iA":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"oj1MhxZDKyGpdd8x","name":"RESEARCH IN THE LIBRARY","content":"<p>On visiting the local library, a successful <strong>Library Use</strong> roll directs the investigator to the <em>Arnoldsburg Advertiser</em>. An article dated over ten years ago concerns the alleged sighting of a band of people, apparently unclothed, cavorting in the cemetery next to the Kimball house. The constable was summoned and the cemetery searched, but no sign of the strangers was ever found, though misshapen footprints gave mute evidence of their presence.</p>\n<p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: if the investigator fails the Library Use roll, they might push the roll by electing to spend longer in the library, or they might ask the librarian to assist them. Both actions serve as justification for a pushed roll. If the pushed roll is failed, the investigator still finds the information noted above but has spent so long in the library that they have stayed passed closing time and have been mistakenly locked in (the librarian didn’t notice them or forgot they were there). Consequently, the investigator has to spend the night alone in the library until 8:00 a.m. the next morning when the librarian returns to open up. Of course, they might try to break out of the library, which calls for further skill rolls, like <strong>Mechanical Repair </strong>or <strong>Locksmith</strong> to open the lock on the front door, or they could use their <strong>STR </strong>to break through a door or window. Or, depending on what the investigator does, you might call for a <strong>Luck </strong>roll to determine if a wandering policeman hears the investigator’s cries for help and comes to their rescue.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xDrgVeFYRFSwH5iA":3},"flags":{}}
