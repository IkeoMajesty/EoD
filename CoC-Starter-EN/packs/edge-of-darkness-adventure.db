events of that night in my youth, I have seen many strange things. Only now do I begin to grasp the truth of reality, and the scope of what is happening in the world. I’ve tried, in my small way, to combat the horrors and make amends for my part in bringing one to our plane of existence. What I have left to offer, what riches and wealth I have, I will put to good use in dealing with these abominations. It is the very least this old coward can do. I could never make myself go back to that little farmhouse and put those events to rights. I too gravely feared that which my friends and I loosed upon this countryside. Nothing of consequence has yet taken place, but with my death I fear the bonds will be broken and that horror freed to come and go as it pleases. Lives not yet taken already weigh heavy on my conscience. The method of delivering the thing out of this world is still in that accursed house—the translations made by Marion from the book, De Vermiis Mysteriis. I was never strong enough to take on the task, but I have hope that you are. In ridding the world of this, perhaps you will save my soul from Hell. For I fear that my deeds have not been enough to release me from this heavy burden. I do not expect your forgiveness for what I ask of you.

It appears to be a small sarcophagus of gold. Inside is a large piece of amber, which entraps a specimen of some unknown species of arthropod. Allen is very excited, as the box corresponds to a description he found in an ordinary reference volume in the university’s Orne Library. Allen says that, in another book—De Vermiis Mysteriis—is an explanation of the powers of the box. The text says the small animal trapped in the amber is actually the host to a bound djinn, a guide to the </span><span class=\"s2\">spirit world. Allen says the tome mentions that originally, there were four such pieces of amber contained in the box. There is no mention what happened to the other three.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">We are agreed and a date has been set to conduct a ceremony intended to summon the djinn, which Allen assures us will be friendly. We have chosen the night of Saturday 18</span><sup><span class=\"s3\">th</span></sup><span class=\"s3\"> March—the night before the New Moon.<br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">March 19th, 1877<br /><br />We began the ceremony as Allen instructed, according to that described in De Vermiis Mysteriis. A fire is set in the fireplace and a pentagram chalked on the floor, marked with appropriate symbols and illuminated by two black tapers placed near the center, flanking the piece of amber with its entrapped spirit. The others sit in a circle while I, the designated “watcher” who guards for malevolent spirits, sit in the corner of the room. At least I get the comfort of a chair, while the others can look forward to sitting on the floor for hours.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Allen throws a handful of powder in the fire, producing an evil-smelling smoke and dampening the flames, which now burn a sputtering green and brown. Those seated on the floor begin the Latin chant Allen has transcribed from his book.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">After nearly two hours I see a trail of smoke circling up from the piece of amber. Its surface seems to be bubbling and melting! Can this be? Have we finally achieved success? I can see a form…<br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">March 20th, 1877<br /><br />We have finished with our plans and have sworn a pact never to speak of what happened last night. We have satisfactorily explained the death of poor Robert, and in some manner the madness of Harold. The sheriff accepts the explanation of a carriage accident—we planned it well. Robert’s neck was broken in the fall, we told him. Harold struck his head on a rock when the horse’s leg broke and the carriage rolled. Would it be that it was only that. For the rest of us, we will be forever changed by what we experienced last night. I will write down the true events, so they are not lost completely.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The thing formed in the center of the pentagram, shapeless and nearly invisible. Its terrible voice should have given us a clue, but we were so foolish. It spoke, then Allen cast that damned powder on the djinn, the “Dust of Ibn-Ghazi” he calls it, and that’s when we could all see it clearly.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">Words cannot adequately describe the faceless thing with a thousand maws. It roiled and bubbled, never fully revealing itself at any one time. So terrifying was its aspect that I was frozen in place, my pen falling from my nerveless fingers. Cecil and Allen seemed as lifeless as myself, while a short, sharp cry issued from Crawford’s mouth. Robert, however, rose to his feet, and before anyone could stop him, stepped forward as though to embrace our horrible guest.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s4\">With its arms, or those appendages that seemed most like arms, it took hold of poor Robert and twisted his head around as though he was a doll. The lifeless corpse was then thrown back in Harold’s lap, and that’s when he began that damnable shrieking—the shrieking that hasn’t stopped since, even after we handed him over to the sheriff’s men.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s5\">We still had a chance, apparently. Allen now believes that if we had kept our wits, we could have reversed the summoning and forced the creature back to wherever it came from. But Crawford panicked and, mistakenly believing that it would dispel the creature, reached forward and destroyed part of the pentagram, breaking the seal and ending its effectiveness. Released from that binding symbol, the thing, with a screech that could only have been unholy satisfaction, was ejected from the house—disappearing out the window as a roaring, screaming wind of boiling colors.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> <br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">March 24th, 1877<br /><br />Allen intends to leave Arkham and travel to find a solution to this crisis. He said that he intends to seek out occult scholars in New Orleans. I pray he is successful, but my hopes are not high at this point. He insisted that I be custodian of the gold sarcophagus, and not show it to anyone. What’s even more odd is that he instructed me to not visit or even live in Boston. I can only guess as to why, as he will not tell me his reasoning, apart from his insistence that it is for my own safety.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Marion still thinks that the thing could yet be destroyed, or at least dispelled, but none of us who remain have the stomach for such an undertaking. I hope he can find a way to safely banish it without another of us falling to its malevolent grip.<br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">March 26th, 1877<br /><br />We now believe that the spell we cast to summon it inextricably bound the thing to the house. Allen went back this morning to retrieve some of our belongings, and store our ritual accouterments. He says that he heard it bumping around in the attic over his head, cursing him all the while. He said that it also told him that it only has to wait us out. When we who were present are all dead, it will roam the Earth freely, slaughtering and feasting. Thankfully, the warding signs carved by Allen during better times, times that seem so long ago now, apparently are effective and bar the thing entry except into the attic of the farm house. I might be able to sleep a few hours tonight knowing it is bound to the attic and cannot harm anyone else.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">I am hopeful for the first time since we stupidly released it from the amber. If it told him the truth, then we have time to seek the answer. God be with you in your search, my friend.<br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">October 14th, 1877<br /><br />I just discovered that Marion Allen is dead, and has been dead for some months now. He was murdered in New Orleans this past August. I suspect that he spoke to the wrong sort of people about the things he has seen, and they killed him. The newspaper mentions the sarcophagus, so they may have been after the gold.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">That is three of us gone now. I must do something. I’ve already begun ancient history classes at university, so I believe I will try to research the problem at the farmhouse in that manner. Perhaps I will uncover an ancient secret of how to rid our world of that beast in my own way.<br /></span></p><hr /><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><br /></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">NEED TO ADD THE TRANSCRIPT FROM THE CUTOUT!<br /><br /></span></p><hr /><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">Robert Menkin, March 1877</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Harold Copley, August 1877</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Marion Allen, August 1877</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Crawford Harris, January 1910</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Cecil Jones, March 1919</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Rupert Merriweather</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span><span class=\"s2\"><br /></span></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":"8b6fODhfi2cVTmKi","sort":112500,"ownership":{"default":0,"x2yoeGi6OjZpS46N":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"CoC7","systemVersion":"0.9.1","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665363475232,"modifiedTime":1667174912958,"lastModifiedBy":"x2yoeGi6OjZpS46N"},"_id":"oAtnJTAGNbjKC34i"},{"name":"Handout 3","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Statement of Corman, Howard, Patrol Officer","type":"image","_id":"0oOGhBmNlcabjlBT","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"I was on my assigned route through the docks and warehouse quarter, nearing the Gulf & Panama docks at 5:47 a.m., when I saw sign of a person lying among some shipping crates.

I then inspected the man to make sure nothing was taken. At this time, it was light enough to see details more clearly, and I saw the mark on the victim’s forehead.

After making sure the door is shut, he reveals why he has called them all here.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"njqmtbB10kqFNeRd","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.TMmGyJ8qaZbMNowP.JournalEntryPage.njqmtbB10kqFNeRd"}}},{"name":"A DARK SECRET","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following information, said by Merriweather, to the investigators:</p><blockquote><p>In my youth, I and some fellow students became involved in what we believed to be an innocent exploration of the occult. Led by a slightly older man named Marion Allen, the six of us purchased an old farmhouse a few miles west of Arkham, near the village of Ross’s Corners. There we could conduct séances and other psychical research in privacy. </p><p>Alas, our work had unforeseen results. Our last experiment summoned an evil force into this world. Instead of attempting to expel the thing, we were afraid and abandoned the old house, confident that the magic that brought the evil to this world would also keep it confined in the vacant house, or send it back after a short time. However, I have since discovered that the spell that binds the entity to the house lasts only as long as the casters live. </p><p>I am the last of the group and I fear that upon my death the thing will go free, and wreak havoc on the folks thereabouts. I am too old, too ill, and too much of a coward to go back to that house to try to banish the entity myself. I am guilty of many things, but my deepest sin was unleashing that horror that fateful night. I am convinced the entity will escape its confinement on my death.</p><p>\"Take the box\" - he says, gesturing weakly towards an innocuous metal box on the nightstand beside the bed.</p><p>All the aid I can offer you lies within. You must find the courage to send that thing back to where it came from. You must see that this is done. Do this for me. Please.</p></blockquote><p>As soon as an investigator takes possession of the box, but before they can open it, the ailing Merriweather is choked by a sudden spasm. He doubles up, groans, and then coughs forth a huge gout of blood—spattering any investigator standing near the night stand—then falls into a coma. All of the investigators must make a <strong>Sanity </strong>roll @coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1,sanMin:0,sanReason:Seeing Marriweather cough forth a huge gout of blood—spattering any investigator standing near the night stand.] (0/1 loss—no loss if the roll is successful, but 1 Sanity point lost if failed).</p><p>Would the investigators like to call for a doctor? If they do, the room quickly fills with interns, nurses, and Merriweather’s concerned wife and son. In the way, the investigators are asked to leave by a harried nurse. Despite the hospital’s best efforts, Merriweather dies within the hour.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> why didn’t Merriweather just go back and banish the thing? It’s been over 40 years! While it’s true that he (or one of the other survivors) could have gone back to try and banish the creature trapped in the vacant house, this is an example of a long-term phobia effect on a character. Despite any guilt felt in knowing that it was still there, none of the survivors could bring themselves to go back to that house. Perhaps some of the people concerned actually convinced themselves that the events of that night were exaggerated by their youthful imaginations and locked the incident away in the recesses of their minds.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Contents of the Box </strong></h3><p>The investigators are probably keen to examine the contents of Merriweather’s box. Perhaps they leave the hospital and gather at a coffee shop nearby to collect their thoughts and open the mysterious container.</p><p>Inside the box is a recently written letter; a yellowed envelope containing the deed to a house and the key to its lock; a small, sarcophagus-shaped gold box of ancient design; and a slim journal bound in leather. Each item is detailed as follows:</p><p></p><h4><em>The Deed and Key</em></h4><p>The deed and key concern a farm property on Boone Road, near Ross’s Corners, a village west of Arkham.</p><p></p><h4><em>The Letter</em></h4><p>The letter is from Rupert Merriweather to the investigators (show the players @UUID[JournalEntry.Z4S5T6DiHo2uIiV3]{Letter from Merriweather}). In it, he tries to explain his reasons for asking them to take on such a dangerous task. The letter only serves to confirm that he is terrified of the house and the creature trapped within it, and fears its release upon his death. </p><p></p><h4><em>The Sarcophagus-Shaped Box</em></h4><p>The lid comes off the ornate box easily; however, there is nothing inside. A successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:History,id:URo2NSSJSNdvOqXU]{History}<strong> </strong>or @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Archeology,id:GHhkcJUqjcP4lToY]{Archeology}<strong> </strong>roll identifies the hieroglyphs decorating the outside of the box as Egyptian, of the Middle Kingdom, although those carved on the inside of the lid are distinctly different and not Egyptian at all. A successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Occult,id:6pSfZVS68jSHxa5T]{Occult} roll reveals that the odd carvings on the inside of the box lid resemble writings attributed by certain occultists to the lost Pacific continent of Mu.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: the mysterious carvings on the inner lid of the box are a “red herring” and not important in this adventure, as the investigators have no way to decipher them. However, the box and its carvings are a potential plot point for a future adventure. One of the fun ways to enjoy Call of Cthulhu is to create your own adventures, and the box is left here so that you might devise a scenario focused on it and the hidden meaning of its carvings. Perhaps the box is an important occult artifact and the language is alien? Perhaps some evil group seeks the box and discovers the investigators now possess it? All of these are potential plots, but you can probably come up with your own ideas and look to turn it into a fun adventure for your players at some future point.</p><hr /><p></p><h4><em>The Slim Journal</em></h4><p>Bound in plain leather and held together by cords, the journal is obviously handmade. Its entries date from June 1876 to May 1881. While the ink has faded with age, a <strong>Language (English</strong>) roll is unnecessary to understand it. Reading through the entries requires approximately four hours’ time. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: the journal holds a record of the Dark Brotherhood’s activities at an old farmhouse. When the investigators wish to read its contents, show them <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.oAtnJTAGNbjKC34i]{Slim Journal}</strong>. (After clicking on the \"Show Players\" button in the top right corner you will be prompted to decide who to show it to and if you want to transfer ownership. Ownership should be transferred for items and clues that players should keep, so go ahead and give them ownership of the journal!) The entries were written by Rupert Merriweather, while a final newspaper clipping, dated August 1882, is pasted next to the entry marking Marion Allen’s grisly murder. Reading the volume costs the reader 1D2 Sanity points (deducted from current Sanity), but also adds 1 percentile to the reader’s Cthulhu Mythos skill, as well as granting a skill check in Occult (ask the player concerned to tick the box next to the Occult skill on their sheet).</p><hr /><p>From reading the volume, the investigators find out about a group of friends, all students at Miskatonic University in Arkham, playfully calling themselves the “Dark Brotherhood.” They held their first meeting in the late spring of 1876. Rupert Merriweather was the group’s recording secretary. The members numbered six, including Marion Allen, the founder and their nominal leader.</p><p>In June of 1876, Merriweather purchased a deserted farmhouse outside Ross’s Corners. This was to be a place where they could conduct their experiments in privacy. Representing themselves as a student literary fraternity, they cleaned and furnished the place, while Marion Allen carved special warding (protective) signs over the wooden doors and windows. At the time, the others were amused at such precautions. A series of experiments, innocent and apparently ineffective attempts to contact the spirit world, are then detailed.</p><p></p><h4><em>The Last Entry</em></h4><p><strong>Note</strong>: the last entry is a list of names, supposedly those who belonged to the Dark Brotherhood, followed by a date—presumably the date of each of their deaths. The dates have been written in various inks, but all by the same hand, suggesting that Merriweather made an account of the deaths of his companions over several years.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"NVKNaTZrtzC31cBq","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1JSjNIqMSKLsrfd2.JournalEntryPage.NVKNaTZrtzC31cBq"}}},{"name":"NEXT STEPS","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>By late afternoon, Rupert Merriweather is dead.

It is likely, however, that the climax of the adventure takes place before the younger Merriweather can enlist the aid of an armed sheriff to evict the squatters from his newly acquired farm.

It notes that little is known about the box, although scholars believe it to have been the possession of the little-known Nophru-Ka, a would-be usurper of the Egyptian throne, who lived during the Third Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. The box was believed to have been given to Nophru-Ka by the gods, and was said to contain djinn that could be called upon to enact some form of service.

There is a dense patch of these in front of the house where a flower and vegetable garden once grew. The flowers have spread across the area, but a successful @coc7.check[type:skill:Spot Hidden]{Spot Hidden} roll detects some well-grown vegetables can still be found in the garden plot. </p><p>Inspecting the tall grass and weeds around the house, a successful @coc7.check[type:skill:Spot Hidden]{Spot Hidden} roll finds a recently dead raccoon laying in the knee-high grass. If the thirty-pound (13.6 kg) carcass is turned over, the cause of death is easily determined. The animal’s breast is stained with clotted blood, and a large hole has been bored into its chest. An investigator making a successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Science (Biology)]{Science (Biology)}<strong>, </strong>@coc7.check[type:skill:Medicine]{Medicine}, or @coc7.check[type:skill:Natural World]{Natural World} roll may determine that the animal’s ribs were wrenched apart and then its heart was neatly scooped out. A fox could have done it, but the investigator has an uneasy feeling after noticing the edges of the wound, which are just too smooth to suggest another animal did this.</p><p>A trail leads off from the house to a small privy, still standing and intact among the trees. A decaying barn stands behind the house, as well as a collapsed lean-to where bundles of firewood were once kept. There are still logs present, but these are damp and will need to be dried in the house before they will burn without excess smoke.</p><p>A water well, made from large stones, stands next to the house. The bucket and rope have long rotted away, so need to be replaced. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> the water in the well is safe to drink, though there is forest litter floating on top. The monster lurking in the farmhouse’s attic killed the raccoon.</p><hr /><h3><em>Looking Further Afield</em></h3><p>Investigators who take the time to wander around the grounds of the property and who enter the surrounding woodland may make a grisly discovery. About 200 yards (183 m) from the barn, within the trees, is the body of a middle-aged woman. The investigators may suddenly come upon the corpse if they are searching the area, which provokes a @coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d4,sanMin:1,sanReason:dicovered a body] <strong>Sanity </strong>roll. </p><p>Examining the body, the investigators find that the woman’s clothes are blood soaked and still wet. Closer examination finds a large hole in her chest. If the investigators already found the dead raccoon, the woman’s wound is disconcertingly similar to that found on the animal: her rib cage has been torn apart. A successful<strong> </strong>@coc7.check[type:skill,name:First Aid]{First Aid} or @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Medicine]{Medicine}<strong> </strong>roll reveals that the woman’s heart is missing.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: the unfortunate woman is the missing Maggie McPhirter, who went out after dark to check on her horses and hasn’t been seen since. Reporting Maggie’s death to the police before they explore the rest of the property, or carry out the ritual, may affect some of the events detailed below; it may also make the investigators persons of interest to the local police, which could hamper their activities. The Keeper should adjust what happens accordingly. </p><hr /><h3><em>Searching the Barn</em></h3><p>If an investigator searches through the remains of the barn, request a @coc7.check[type:characteristic,name:dex]{dex} roll to traverse the debris without tripping. A failed roll results in a fall, causing [[/r 1d3]] // [[1d3]] hit points damage from cutting a hand or leg on some broken glass. The remains of several rusted farm tools and horse tack are all there is to find here. There are no animals larger than a rat living in the barn or on the property. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: the monster in the farmhouse’s attic kills most of the animals that come into the area at night.</p><hr /><h3><em>Approaching the Farmhouse</em></h3><p>The remains of a porch swing rest at the edge of the trees that once supported it.

She planted the flower and vegetable garden in front of the house. The bench swing was an anniversary gift Bradley made for her.</p><p>The couple tended their farm for several years, earning enough from their crops to have a good life. In time, Sarah contracted pneumonia, forcing Bradley to take her to Boston for treatment. He put the farm up as collateral for a loan from the bank to cover her medical bills, and this is how he eventually lost the property.

(If they didn’t think to pick up such items, there’s a lantern hanging by the front door, but also call for a @coc7.check[type:attribute,name:lck]{Luck}<strong> </strong>roll to see if they can find a pair of lanterns and some oil and wicks in the barn.) The only light source down in the cellar is a lantern sitting on a shelf across the room, which the investigators may find with a successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Spot Hidden]{Spot Hidden} roll. The good news is that the lantern is full of oil and the wick is still useable.</p><p>The cellar is small and has a low ceiling, making the room feel claustrophobic. The floor is hard-packed earth. It’s cooler than the house above and smells of dirt and dust. There is a pair of chairs against a wall at the base of the steps, and a table with a missing leg resting on its side. Shelves line one wall. Cans and boxes sit on the shelves, each holding the long-spoiled remains of foodstuffs. Several tins of tea leaves lurk among the cans, complete with silver tea set, now long tarnished. There are a few cast iron pots and pans for cooking, and sets of tableware for eating. Additionally, on the lowest shelf, is a row of bottles containing good liquor. </p><p>By the steps leading into the cellar is an old but still sturdy 8-foot (2.5 m) ladder. Behind the steps is a pile of lumber, a bag of rusted nails, and a wooden box with some old tools: hammer, hand saw, hand drill with 3 different bits, chisel, and rasp. In a corner near the shelves is a bundle under an oiled tarpaulin. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: if the tarpaulin is removed, the investigators find an expensive looking travel trunk. The straps are fastened, and latches secured. See The Trunk (following). All of the supplies down here were brought by the Dark Brotherhood, who stocked up for the weekends they spent here.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Trunk</strong></h3><p>If the trunk is opened, the investigators see a folded black cloth, with a handwritten letter resting on top. On the underside lid of the trunk are more warding sigils (carved by Marion Allen). Within the trunk are materials mentioned in Rupert Merriweather’s journal (@UUID[JournalEntry.oAtnJTAGNbjKC34i]{Slim Journal})—listed below. If the investigators read the letter, give them @UUID[JournalEntry.mqYyob5xdCovhGmI]{Handout 5}.</p><ul><li>Six folded black robes.</li><li>Cigar box (see following).</li><li>A sheaf of yellowed papers (see following).</li></ul><h3>Cigar Box</h3><p>The box and brand of cigars date to the 1870s. Once opened, inside is a small metal canister containing a coarse and brownish powder, and a smaller wooden box with a sliding lid. Within the smaller box is a silvery, talcum powder-like substance. </p><p>A successful Science (@coc7.check[type:skill,name:Chemistry]{Chemistry} or @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Pharmacy]{Pharmacy}) roll identifies sulfur and oxide of copper as constituents of the brown powder.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> the brown powder is burned in a fire during the ritual to summon or dispel the monster.</p><hr /><p>The silvery talcum powder defies identification—even if subjected to laboratory analysis. The powdery substance is somewhat like graphite and adheres to the skin, coating it and imparting a greasy feel, but washes off easily. </p><p>Should an investigator make a successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Cthulhu Mythos]{Cthulhu Mythos} roll (highly unlikely due to the fact that the investigators probably have little to zero ability in this special skill) they can identify the silvery talcum powder as the @UUID[.4jOak4lu4dJvcvSC]{POWDER OF IBN-GHAZI}. Note that Dr. Armitage (Orne Library at Miskatonic University), if shown the powder, could identify its true name and purpose. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> the investigators don’t necessarily need to know what the powder is called or even what it actually is in order to use it against the monster in the attic. If necessary, ask for an INT roll to deduce that the powder might be useful against the monster; presumably, if thrown at the monster, it might have some effect. </p><hr /><h3>Sheaf of Yellowed Papers </h3><p>The papers are handwritten notes, all dated from 1877. All the sheets are in Marion Allen’s handwriting. None of the writing mentions the silvery talcum-like powder (Powder of Ibn-Ghazi). Key information contained in the papers is described as follows:</p><p>Six of the sheets of paper are all the same, all of them copies of the same Latin chant (these were prepared as separate copies for each of the members of the Dark Brotherhood)—@UUID[JournalEntry.bgcbteiYPjTfFjUJ.JournalEntryPage.VkJfJU7AbEPJOmim]{Chant}. The phrases are in Latin; a successful <strong>Language (Latin)</strong> roll can translate the text —<strong> </strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.bgcbteiYPjTfFjUJ.JournalEntryPage.cMUGpXLgUhQMbmDK]{Translation of Chant}.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> This time we will try something different. Don't show to players the whole Journal with the handout, but show them only one page of it. To do so instead of the eye in the top right corner, right-click on @UUID[JournalEntry.bgcbteiYPjTfFjUJ.JournalEntryPage.VkJfJU7AbEPJOmim]{Latin Chant} in the page list and choose \"Show to players.\" then ask players to make a Language (Latin) check. By going to their Character sheet and clicking the corresponding skill if they have it. If someone pass, only then show them the second page @UUID[JournalEntry.bgcbteiYPjTfFjUJ.JournalEntryPage.cMUGpXLgUhQMbmDK]{Translation of Chant} following this same procedure.</p><hr /><p>One sheet identifies the Latin chant as having been derived from a book called De Vermiis Mysteriis. It also states that, while the original chant detailed the ritual for “releasing the spirit trapped inside the ancient amber,” several words within the incantation have been replaced, changing the original summoning ritual to one of exorcism so that it may be used to dispel the vile spirit currently trapped in the attic.</p><p>One sheet contains a description of a pentagram and says the symbol must be drawn as part of the ritual—<strong> </strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.LucazsWoWEZfCe79]{Handout 8}.</p><p>Three sheets discuss the procedure of the ritual itself, which takes at least an hour to perform and must be started at midnight. While at least one person speaks aloud the ritual phrases, another person must draw the pentagram on the floor, while another burns a certain combination of chemicals in a fire nearby. Allen’s notes mention that the chemicals resemble a brown powder, which he says he has prepared and stored with these papers in a metal canister ready for use. While one person may perform the ritual chant, the notes recommend that several people take part, allowing each individual to occasionally interrupt their chanting without disturbing the overall ritual or its potency. If the chant is continuous, with at least one person reciting the repeating phrases aloud, the “spirit” must succumb; however, it warns that even the slightest disruption of the chanting may result in failure, requiring another ritual to be performed on a following night. The notes suggest that during the ritual, “a watcher be posted, lest the sorcerers be disturbed by the nuisances and distractions of malevolent spirits.” Thus, these sheets confirm that a two-hour ritual using the chant provided, begun at midnight, will drive off unwanted spirits.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note: </strong>finding the yellowed papers and the old cigar box in the trunk is an important clue, which serves to provide the investigators with a means to dispel the monster lurking in the farmhouse. Without this important information, the investigators will fail in their task to banish the horror. It’s okay if the investigators don’t find the papers initially. Later on, once they realize they are in danger, the Keeper can remind the players that they did not search certain rooms or that they forgot to look in the trunk, and so on. Giving the players a nudge in the right direction without necessarily telling them what to do is fine. Remember, the Keeper provides the information but it’s up to the players to use what they are told. If the Keeper has reminded the players about something they may have missed, but which they then choose to ignore, then on their own heads be it!</p><hr />","markdown":""},"_id":"4hjW6wGD8EvrgChm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.UBbhmplPWdMrAv9A.JournalEntryPage.4hjW6wGD8EvrgChm"}}},{"name":"POWDER OF IBN-GHAZI","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":3},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"example\"><h2>POWDER OF IBN-GHAZI</h2><p>The Powder of Ibn-Ghazi is a rare magical substance, created through specialist arcane knowledge.

However, if the Lurker’s attack kills the investigator outright (they lose all of their hit points from the attack and fall), it indicates that the talons have caught in the investigator’s skull. With a scream, the Lurker hauls up the dangling corpse, rips out its heart, and then throws the carcass back down through the opening. Witnesses to this horror should make a <strong>Sanity </strong>roll @coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d6,sanMin:1]. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: did you notice how each outcome described above provides a different Sanity point loss? As the severity and horror is increased for certain possible outcomes, the Sanity loss is also increased. Only one of the outcomes is possible (the investigator dodges and falls, the monster hits them, or the monster kills them), so only one set of Sanity losses is applied (ignore the outcomes that don’t actually happen). Additionally, investigator death is common in Call of Cthulhu (it’s a horror game after all). Should one of the investigators die, the player concerned can create a new investigator to jump back into the game after a reasonable pause. The new investigator could be another associate of the other players’ investigators—perhaps they run from the house after the death of one of their own and then head back to Ross’s Corners to use a telephone to call for help. Alternatively, the new investigator might be a local person, come by the house when searching for the missing Maggie McPhirter, who becomes embroiled in the adventure. Talk to the players about how the new investigator could arrive, as some of the players are likely to suggest good ideas. Agree the most appropriate, and introduce the new investigator accordingly, dropping them into the action when the time comes.</p><hr /><p><strong>Another Keeper note:</strong> some players may, after the death of an investigator, think to call the police for help. As Keeper, you have a choice: do the police respond or do they ignore the plea? Ask yourself: are the police likely to believe crazy stories of monsters living in attics? Probably not. If the players use some other more believable tactic, a policeman might be sent to the farmhouse to check things out (depending on any previous interactions the investigators may have had with local law enforcement). On investigating, he looks in the attic but is immediately killed by the Lurker. Now, as the investigators have effectively sent an innocent man to his death, they must make another <strong>Sanity </strong>roll @coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d6,sanMin:1,sanReason:innocent man died] for comprehending their role in the death—plus they may have some explaining to do! Another alternative is to have the policeman be the replacement investigator, which puts his actions into the hands of the player—ignore the advice above and don’t automatically kill him off: let him join the investigators and attempt to solve the mystery.</p><hr />","markdown":""},"_id":"WhI3VIch8rsjqMsp","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2000000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.2GKNfrIhfuUqbodT.JournalEntryPage.WhI3VIch8rsjqMsp"}}},{"name":"ABOUT THE LURKER","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>This monster is a near invisible and barely material manifestation from another dimension.

Setting the house ablaze does not harm the creature, but rather encourages it to take up residence nearer to Ross’s Corners!</p><p>Dispelling the monster takes around two hours of continual chanting, begun at midnight. A properly drawn pentagram and a fire burning some of the brown chemical compound found with Allen’s notes are also required. These notes also suggest that at least one person stand back from the ceremony in order to watch for malevolent spirits that may be drawn to the rites, but the investigators may do as they wish.</p><p>To dispel the Lurker, several of the words in the chant have been changed; the altered ritual is in the documents found in the trunk in the cellar (page 38). Individual chanters may stop now and then to catch their breaths, but at least one person must be chanting at any given moment. Each investigator participating in the chant donates 2 magic points every half hour they join in the chant. A total of 8 magic points is required for the ritual to work; thus, if two investigators are chanting non-stop, they will generate enough magic points in one hour, shortening the ritual. If an investigator’s magic points reach zero, deduct further magic point losses directly from their hit points (one for one); the damage this causes can be reflected by cuts opening on the investigator’s skin, bleeding thick, red blood down their clothes and onto the floor. Note that the Lurker will try to prevent the chanting, so some investigators may need to break off to defend themselves or defend the other chanters; thus, it may also take longer than two hours for the investigators to generate the 8 required magic points.</p><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: for a reminder about magic points, see <strong>Step Two: Secondary Attributes</strong>, page 7, in <strong>Book Two</strong>.</p><p><strong>Before the Ritual Begins</strong></p><p>Once the investigators have figured out that they must perform the ritual to banish the monster, they must wait until midnight to begin. Depending on the time that the investigators reach this conclusion, the Lurker may depart the house to seek out food. At sunset, hours before the investigators can begin the ritual, the creature leaves the house. With an ear-piercing shriek, it screams out of the attic and across the fields towards the nearby woods. A Listen roll is unnecessary to hear it exit.

A successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Spot Hidden]{Spot Hidden}<strong> </strong>roll, or if a lantern or flashlight is used (no roll), reveals a middle-aged woman, obviously hurt, making her way to the house. She lifts her head and calls toward the house. Her face is streaked with blood. What do the investigators do?</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: this is the reanimated corpse of the missing Maggie McPhirter. She has been dead for 24 hours, her heart chewed out by the Lurker in the Attic. The monster has spent 5 magic points to animate the body and thereby disrupt the ceremony. If they didn’t find her body during their preliminary searches of the property, then the investigators won’t be aware of who she is (was) until they get a closer look at her, triggering a <strong>Sanity </strong>roll (@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d6,sanMin:1,sanReason:animated body of a woman ]). However, if they do know who she is, they must make a Sanity roll as soon as they see her. Obviously, if the investigators have already reported Maggie’s death to the police and her body has been removed, then the Lurker cannot use her in its attacks.</p><hr /><p>Anyone going outside is attacked, either by @UUID[Actor.90YkPuyyf4Xd7Mqo]{Zombie Maggie Mcphirter} (if present) or, if the Keeper chooses cruelty, by the @UUID[Actor.1ZvcG6zuxTv5sbyc]{The Lurker in the Attic} itself. The Lurker may also animate the corpse of @UUID[Actor.fLYo6s4gncsWSH0u]{Zombie Red Jake} if it managed to kill him, too, using it to attack any investigator attempting to help the woman. If the animated dead fail to lure the investigators out, the Lurker has its puppets assault the house, pushing on the doors or windows, screaming, shouting, hollering, and biting. The undead corpses cannot enter the house because of the wards, but they can throw rocks or branches through windows and at doors, and they can attempt to tear down the wood above windows and doors on which the wards are etched—if the investigators do not stop them from doing this, then the torn down ward is useless and the undead may enter the farmhouse to cause even more mayhem. They are fearsome, but not very difficult to destroy. The Sanity losses they provoke may be their most dangerous aspect. </p><p>The Lurker may also animate animals it has killed to attack the house, or any investigator outside it (costing it 5 magic points per large—bear-size—creature, or 1 magic point for small animals, such as a raccoon or bird). The reanimation lasts for up to 3 hours or until the reanimated corpse is destroyed. Profiles for the reanimated Maggie and Red Jake, as well as a reanimated raccoon and a brown bear can be found in Actors tab under <code>NPC/Monsters</code> folder. These creatures are options for the Keeper to use, if so desired. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: if the Keeper wishes to be really cruel, then the Lurker can adopt a particularly devious strategy. Although the reanimated dead cannot pass Allen’s protective wards while they are intact, the Lurker can, nevertheless, throw the carcasses of those creatures left in the attic down through the hatch and into the house, only bringing them back to “life” once they are passed the wards that would otherwise stop them from gaining entry. This strategy is only recommended if there are four to five well-armed investigators able to deal with these undead furry nemeses. At the very least, it should encourage the investigators to get on with banishing the creature once and for all. </p><hr /><p>Able to generate all manner of odors, the Lurker can lure or disorientate the investigators. It can mimic anything it has experienced, so the smell of fresh baked bread or roasted meats are options to confuse investigators into acting rashly. Remember, the Lurker is able to interact with anything outside the two rooms that are warded in the farmhouse. If the investigators traveled in a car, it can cause the horn to go off, doors to slam, and create general mayhem. Alternatively, it can sit on the car and taunt from outside, and then proceed to tear the automobile apart. A nasty Keeper might have the Lurker leave invisible acidic slime all over the interior of the car—after banishing the monster, the investigators suffer acid damage when they go to leave! (Which can make for a fun scene the morning after.)</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: why doesn’t the Lurker just go through the walls around the wards? This is a logical question regarding an illogical circumstance. Entities from outside our dimension are subject to magical wards. Sensing these protective energies, they are “put off ” by them. While the wards are placed over windows and doors, they act to seal the entire room. While the Lurker is not powerful enough to cause the earth to tremble and cause the house’s walls to fall down (destroying the wards), some other monsters from the Cthulhu Mythos are. Luckily, for the investigators, such horrors do not feature in this adventure!</p><hr /><p><strong>An option</strong>: the investigators do not need to make skill rolls for performing the ritual, although the Keeper could—optionally, if wanting to add to the tension—decide that certain skill rolls are required. The following are suggestions: an <strong>Art/Craft (Drawing, Art, etc )</strong> or @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Occult]{Occult}<strong> </strong>roll to correctly draw the pentagram on the floor; a <strong>DEX </strong>roll to correctly time the burning of the brown powder; and a <strong>POW </strong>or <strong>CON </strong>roll from those reciting the Latin phrases to ensure they maintain the chant. If incorporating these optional skill rolls, allow the investigators to push failed rolls, with the consequence of a pushed failure being that the Lurker’s zombies break through the wards into the room, allowing the monsters to physically menace the proceedings.</p><h3><strong>The Lurker Appears</strong> </h3><p>Nearing the last five minutes of the ritual, a wisp of oily smoke curls down from the ceiling, twisting towards the center of the pentagram on the floor. The creature from the attic is drawn through the wards before the investigators’ eyes. </p><p>At this point, any animated corpses under the Lurker’s control are released and fall lifeless to the ground. Any other effects the Lurker was creating also stop abruptly. Four more minutes of chanting is all that is required to drive it back to its place in the dimension it hails from. As it begins to condense in the pentagram, it becomes partially visible—appearing in the form of someone the investigators know. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: when the Lurker appears, it takes the form of a familiar face—ideally, take inspiration from one of the investigators’  <strong>Significant People </strong>in the Backstory section on the reverse of their investigator sheets. Alternatively, it could choose Red Jake, if it hasn’t been able to use his corpse to attack them already. The Lurker appears like this to fool the investigators and tempt them into making a deal (see below). The Keeper has the option of allowing an investigator to make a @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Psychology]{Psychology}<strong> </strong>roll to see through the disguise. Once an investigator dismisses the Lurker’s disguise, it can change form again into another investigator’s Significant Person, if the Keeper desires. Any that dismiss the Lurker’s disguise get to see its real form: a horrible twisting mass of talons and maws and long appendages, which provokes a <strong>Sanity </strong>roll (@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d8,sanMin:1,sanReason:real form of Lurker ]) —but subtract any points already lost when previously observing the Lurker leave the house at sunset. In addition, if any investigator goes insane, they now see the Lurker as a terrified and confused human child, rather than a horrible monster. As an involuntary action, an insane investigator steps forward to embrace and comfort the child. Unless stopped, they could die, as although the monster is confined within the pentagram, it can attack anyone who crosses the symbol’s perimeter. </p><hr /><p>The Lurker, taking the form of someone known to an investigator, can attempt to make deals with the investigators at this point. It can offer information to things they personally seek: locating a missing relative, translation of a rare book, or even arcane lore (5 percentile points in the Cthulhu Mythos skill). These are only some of the things it can tempt or bargain with for its release—the Keeper is invited to create more temptations appropriate to the investigators. The Lurker may be able to grant some of these whispered bribes, but is unlikely to carry through with its promises. In this capacity, it does fit the classic role of djinn-like beings. Do the investigators listen and accept the bribes, or do they continue on and complete Merriweather’s dying wish?</p><p>If an investigator breaks the pentagram on the floor (i.e. causes a break in the drawing), the Lurker is free of the binding and can attack anyone it likes. If the undead have broken in and some investigators are engaged in fighting, call for a <strong>Luck </strong>roll @coc7.check[type:attribute,name:lck]{don't break the pentagram drawing} each round to determine if an investigator in combat has inadvertently stepped on and broken the pentagram. </p><p>If the investigators dismiss the Lurker’s bargaining and finish the last few minutes of the chant, the monster is driven wailing from this world, vowing revenge on the investigators for their deeds. Banished, it leaves only a lingering, unearthly foulness behind.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"iF9xW2Ih0MEutjne","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0McFJVwHZMYfKW7M.JournalEntryPage.iF9xW2Ih0MEutjne"}}},{"name":"CONCLUSION","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Either the investigators successfully banished the Lurker and, more or less, survived the adventure, or they were driven from the farmhouse and fear to return.

This loss results from the knowledge that the Lurker remains free.

You don’t have to use any of the following ideas, and can end the scenario as described above. But, if your players want to continue the game, these ideas serve as possibilities, allowing you to extend the scenario a little, or you could use them to start a new investigation of your own design.</p><ul><li>Do the investigators leave the area without reporting any deaths or the discovery of Maggie McPhirter’s body? Or do they satisfactorily explain to the sheriff what happened? The sheriff will not believe stories of monsters and zombies, so the investigators will need to think up plausible explanations if they do not want to become “persons of interest” in the sheriff ’s eyes.</li><li>Do the investigators benefit from Rupert Merriweather’s will? He considered them fine and trustworthy people; perhaps he rewarded them with a gift from his estate. Options for this include a car for the investigators to drive around in, a collection of books and artifacts, which have some dark connection to the Cthulhu Mythos, or just a key to a post office box that contains pages of mysterious writing and an equally mysterious map with a circled area on it. These last two could drive the investigators into a new scenario, where the artifact, book, or map lead them into another mystery and encounter with a dark cult or monster.</li><li>Who or what murdered Marion Allen all those years ago in New Orleans? Were they cultists desperately searching for the sarcophagus of Nophru-Ka? Could such evil cultists learn that it is now in the investigators’ possession and come looking for it? Looking into the background of Marion Allen, the investigators may find that Allen was briefly affiliated with the Chapel of Contemplation in Boston. Who was the uncle that Marion feared would look for him? The manner of Allen’s death is not dissimilar from what the Lurker did to its victims, but on a much larger scale. The Keeper can decide if it was human agency that inflicted the wounds or if those seeking the gold sarcophagus sent a monster after him.</li><li>And what about the investigators’ jobs? They may have now missed several days of work and need a cover story for their bosses. What flimflam can they come with to pacify their bosses? Certainly, they can’t tell the truth!</li></ul>","markdown":""},"_id":"AUvOiqdEgfvaPWPP","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.32K2FDEjW2Gm2iUq.JournalEntryPage.AUvOiqdEgfvaPWPP"}}},{"sort":1700000,"name":"Combat","type":"text","_id":"zI5y2RRLH2kF8KRV","title":{"show":false,"level":3},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"example\"><h2>COMBAT</h2><p>With Red Jake’s surprise attack dealt with, any further combat now follows the standard procedure (see Book Two: Combat, page 18). Compare the DEX of any investigators involved in the scene with Red Jake’s DEX of 60. The order of who gets to act first is decided in DEX order, highest first. On everyone’s DEX turn, the character gets to do one thing: most likely to attack.</p><p>• Making an attack: roll 1D100 and compare this to the character’s <strong>Fighting </strong>skill to judge if the attack was successful; if so, was it a Regular, Hard, or Extreme success? The defender gets to respond by announcing whether they are attempting to Dodge or Fight Back (<strong>Book Two: Close Combat</strong>, page 18). Usually, the attacker and defender roll their dice at the same time and then compare the results. Whoever wins the combat gets to deal damage. </p><p>• Remember, everyone involved in the combat gets to act on their DEX turn, as well as getting to react (Dodge or Fight Back) against each attack made on them. •If two or more characters are attacking a single opponent, they Outnumber the opponent and may gain a bonus die to their attack roll (<strong>Book Two: Outnumbered</strong>, page 20). •Rather than attack, an investigator could decide to tackle and hold the opponent, using a Fighting Maneuver (<strong>Book Two</strong>, page 19).</p><p>•Alternatively, an investigator might try to reason rather than attack at all. What skill is the investigator using?<strong>Charm, Fast Talk, Persuade, </strong>or<strong> Intimidate</strong>? Their manner and choice of delivery determines which of these skills is used.

The opponent might surrender, turn tail and run away, or pause only to then resume attacking. </p><p>In the case of Red Jake, he surrenders if one of the investigators convinces him they mean him no harm; otherwise, he will defend himself if the investigators decide to attack him.

Fleeing the house in a panic, leaving his meager belongings behind, he was chased down by the monster that inhabits the house.</p><p>His escape was narrow. He fled from the monster, which seemed about to catch and attack him, when it suddenly veered away into the woods behind the barn. Little does Red Jake know that the monster heard Maggie McPhirter and chose to attack her instead, carrying her away to where her body now lies (see Looking Further Afield, page 32). Not quite believing his luck in escaping the monster, Red Jake spent the night shivering and hiding under a tree.</p><p>Eventually building up the courage to reenter the house, Red Jake sneaked back inside to retrieve his belongings, only to be surprised by the arrival of the investigators. He now hides in the dark cellar. Paranoid and fearful, he is temporarily insane from last night’s encounter with the horror. </p><p>A number of possibilities exist for what could happen with Red Jake, as follows:</p><h3><em>If Red Jake is Left Undisturbed</em></h3><p>If left alone, Red Jake waits until the time is right and then bolts upstairs, grabs what he can of his possessions left on the table, and darts out of the back door, heading for the woods. Unless the investigators can run him down, he does not return.</p><p><br />Chase: if trying to catch Red Jake, ask the investigator chasing to make an opposed @coc7.check[type:characteristic,name:dex]{DEX} roll.

If the player wishes, they can attempt another opposed roll until the chase is ended. If Red Jakes wins two consecutive opposed rolls, he manages to get away, but if the investigator wins a single opposed roll then Red Jake has been caught—allowing the investigators to hear his story concerning his encounter with the monster. If you need a reminder about <strong>Opposed Skill Rolls</strong>, see page 14 in <strong>Book Two</strong>.</p><h3><em>If the Investigators Enter the Cellar</em></h3><p>If someone goes downstairs, perhaps investigating the strange noises, Red Jake jumps out of the shadows and makes a surprise attack with an old table leg.

A successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Psychology]{Psychology}<strong> </strong>roll determines he is in shock, so if the investigators act to calm him down, they manage to get a few scraps of information from him. Alternatively, a successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Psychoanalysis]{Psychoanalysis} roll works to calm Red Jake down enough for him to talk.</p><p>Red Jake describes how he found the house yesterday while traveling through the countryside, and how, during the night, he heard strange sounds and was then attacked by what he calls a “monster.” He says the monster made a piercing shriek as it hunted him in the woods, but that it also created a stench, like rotting meat. He was lucky to get away, as it seemed the monster heard something in the woods and left him alone to go investigate.</p><p>He has been aimlessly traveling up and down the Eastern seaboard since he returned from the Great War. He tells those who listen that he has family in California, who he’s trying to get back to. He’s an honest man by nature but is too undisciplined and impulsive to hold down a regular job. He makes what little money he can by doing handyman chores for those folks that will let him. If the investigators search Red Jake, they find his pockets contain a folded straight razor, a whetstone, a whistle, and 32 cents earned from his last odd job.</p><h3><em>What Happens to Red Jake?</em></h3><p>The investigators could take Red Jake to Ross’s Corners and turn him over to Pa Peters, the Justice of the Peace. With Maggie McPhirter missing (unless her body has been discovered), the police pin her “abduction” on Red Jake and he is arrested to face trial. If the investigators play a role in bringing Maggie McPhirter’s death to the attention of the police, then they save Red Jake from a prison sentence, but may, inadvertently, cause complications for their own investigations. </p><p>If Red Jake runs away and escapes the investigators (or they simply let him go), he dies that night, the second victim of the monster in the attic. He may return after death to pay the investigators a surprise visit (see <strong>Enacting the Ritua</strong>l, page 45).

events of that night in my youth, I have seen many strange things. Only now do I begin to grasp the truth of reality, and the scope of what is happening in the world. I’ve tried, in my small way, to combat the horrors and make amends for my part in bringing one to our plane of existence. What I have left to offer, what riches and wealth I have, I will put to good use in dealing with these abominations. It is the very least this old coward can do. I could never make myself go back to that little farmhouse and put those events to rights. I too gravely feared that which my friends and I loosed upon this countryside. Nothing of consequence has yet taken place, but with my death I fear the bonds will be broken and that horror freed to come and go as it pleases. Lives not yet taken already weigh heavy on my conscience. The method of delivering the thing out of this world is still in that accursed house—the translations made by Marion from the book, De Vermiis Mysteriis. I was never strong enough to take on the task, but I have hope that you are. In ridding the world of this, perhaps you will save my soul from Hell. For I fear that my deeds have not been enough to release me from this heavy burden. I do not expect your forgiveness for what I ask of you.

It appears to be a small sarcophagus of gold. Inside is a large piece of amber, which entraps a specimen of some unknown species of arthropod. Allen is very excited, as the box corresponds to a description he found in an ordinary reference volume in the university’s Orne Library. Allen says that, in another book—De Vermiis Mysteriis—is an explanation of the powers of the box. The text says the small animal trapped in the amber is actually the host to a bound djinn, a guide to the </span><span class=\"s2\">spirit world. Allen says the tome mentions that originally, there were four such pieces of amber contained in the box. There is no mention what happened to the other three.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">We are agreed and a date has been set to conduct a ceremony intended to summon the djinn, which Allen assures us will be friendly. We have chosen the night of Saturday 18</span><sup><span class=\"s3\">th</span></sup><span class=\"s3\"> March—the night before the New Moon.<br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">March 19th, 1877<br /><br />We began the ceremony as Allen instructed, according to that described in De Vermiis Mysteriis. A fire is set in the fireplace and a pentagram chalked on the floor, marked with appropriate symbols and illuminated by two black tapers placed near the center, flanking the piece of amber with its entrapped spirit. The others sit in a circle while I, the designated “watcher” who guards for malevolent spirits, sit in the corner of the room. At least I get the comfort of a chair, while the others can look forward to sitting on the floor for hours.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Allen throws a handful of powder in the fire, producing an evil-smelling smoke and dampening the flames, which now burn a sputtering green and brown. Those seated on the floor begin the Latin chant Allen has transcribed from his book.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">After nearly two hours I see a trail of smoke circling up from the piece of amber. Its surface seems to be bubbling and melting! Can this be? Have we finally achieved success? I can see a form…<br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">March 20th, 1877<br /><br />We have finished with our plans and have sworn a pact never to speak of what happened last night. We have satisfactorily explained the death of poor Robert, and in some manner the madness of Harold. The sheriff accepts the explanation of a carriage accident—we planned it well. Robert’s neck was broken in the fall, we told him. Harold struck his head on a rock when the horse’s leg broke and the carriage rolled. Would it be that it was only that. For the rest of us, we will be forever changed by what we experienced last night. I will write down the true events, so they are not lost completely.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The thing formed in the center of the pentagram, shapeless and nearly invisible. Its terrible voice should have given us a clue, but we were so foolish. It spoke, then Allen cast that damned powder on the djinn, the “Dust of Ibn-Ghazi” he calls it, and that’s when we could all see it clearly.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">Words cannot adequately describe the faceless thing with a thousand maws. It roiled and bubbled, never fully revealing itself at any one time. So terrifying was its aspect that I was frozen in place, my pen falling from my nerveless fingers. Cecil and Allen seemed as lifeless as myself, while a short, sharp cry issued from Crawford’s mouth. Robert, however, rose to his feet, and before anyone could stop him, stepped forward as though to embrace our horrible guest.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s4\">With its arms, or those appendages that seemed most like arms, it took hold of poor Robert and twisted his head around as though he was a doll. The lifeless corpse was then thrown back in Harold’s lap, and that’s when he began that damnable shrieking—the shrieking that hasn’t stopped since, even after we handed him over to the sheriff’s men.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s5\">We still had a chance, apparently. Allen now believes that if we had kept our wits, we could have reversed the summoning and forced the creature back to wherever it came from. But Crawford panicked and, mistakenly believing that it would dispel the creature, reached forward and destroyed part of the pentagram, breaking the seal and ending its effectiveness. Released from that binding symbol, the thing, with a screech that could only have been unholy satisfaction, was ejected from the house—disappearing out the window as a roaring, screaming wind of boiling colors.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> <br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">March 24th, 1877<br /><br />Allen intends to leave Arkham and travel to find a solution to this crisis. He said that he intends to seek out occult scholars in New Orleans. I pray he is successful, but my hopes are not high at this point. He insisted that I be custodian of the gold sarcophagus, and not show it to anyone. What’s even more odd is that he instructed me to not visit or even live in Boston. I can only guess as to why, as he will not tell me his reasoning, apart from his insistence that it is for my own safety.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Marion still thinks that the thing could yet be destroyed, or at least dispelled, but none of us who remain have the stomach for such an undertaking. I hope he can find a way to safely banish it without another of us falling to its malevolent grip.<br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">March 26th, 1877<br /><br />We now believe that the spell we cast to summon it inextricably bound the thing to the house. Allen went back this morning to retrieve some of our belongings, and store our ritual accouterments. He says that he heard it bumping around in the attic over his head, cursing him all the while. He said that it also told him that it only has to wait us out. When we who were present are all dead, it will roam the Earth freely, slaughtering and feasting. Thankfully, the warding signs carved by Allen during better times, times that seem so long ago now, apparently are effective and bar the thing entry except into the attic of the farm house. I might be able to sleep a few hours tonight knowing it is bound to the attic and cannot harm anyone else.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">I am hopeful for the first time since we stupidly released it from the amber. If it told him the truth, then we have time to seek the answer. God be with you in your search, my friend.<br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">October 14th, 1877<br /><br />I just discovered that Marion Allen is dead, and has been dead for some months now. He was murdered in New Orleans this past August. I suspect that he spoke to the wrong sort of people about the things he has seen, and they killed him. The newspaper mentions the sarcophagus, so they may have been after the gold.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">That is three of us gone now. I must do something. I’ve already begun ancient history classes at university, so I believe I will try to research the problem at the farmhouse in that manner. Perhaps I will uncover an ancient secret of how to rid our world of that beast in my own way.<br /></span></p><hr /><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><br /></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">NEED TO ADD THE TRANSCRIPT FROM THE CUTOUT!<br /><br /></span></p><hr /><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><br /><br /></span><span class=\"s1\">Robert Menkin, March 1877</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Harold Copley, August 1877</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Marion Allen, August 1877</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Crawford Harris, January 1910</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Cecil Jones, March 1919</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Rupert Merriweather</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span><span class=\"s2\"><br /></span></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":"8b6fODhfi2cVTmKi","sort":112500,"ownership":{"default":0,"x2yoeGi6OjZpS46N":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"CoC7","systemVersion":"0.9.1","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665363475232,"modifiedTime":1667174912958,"lastModifiedBy":"x2yoeGi6OjZpS46N"},"_id":"oAtnJTAGNbjKC34i"},{"name":"Handout 3","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Statement of Corman, Howard, Patrol Officer","type":"image","_id":"0oOGhBmNlcabjlBT","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"I was on my assigned route through the docks and warehouse quarter, nearing the Gulf & Panama docks at 5:47 a.m., when I saw sign of a person lying among some shipping crates.

I then inspected the man to make sure nothing was taken. At this time, it was light enough to see details more clearly, and I saw the mark on the victim’s forehead.

After making sure the door is shut, he reveals why he has called them all here.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"njqmtbB10kqFNeRd","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.TMmGyJ8qaZbMNowP.JournalEntryPage.njqmtbB10kqFNeRd"}}},{"name":"A DARK SECRET","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following information, said by Merriweather, to the investigators:</p><blockquote><p>In my youth, I and some fellow students became involved in what we believed to be an innocent exploration of the occult. Led by a slightly older man named Marion Allen, the six of us purchased an old farmhouse a few miles west of Arkham, near the village of Ross’s Corners. There we could conduct séances and other psychical research in privacy. </p><p>Alas, our work had unforeseen results. Our last experiment summoned an evil force into this world. Instead of attempting to expel the thing, we were afraid and abandoned the old house, confident that the magic that brought the evil to this world would also keep it confined in the vacant house, or send it back after a short time. However, I have since discovered that the spell that binds the entity to the house lasts only as long as the casters live. </p><p>I am the last of the group and I fear that upon my death the thing will go free, and wreak havoc on the folks thereabouts. I am too old, too ill, and too much of a coward to go back to that house to try to banish the entity myself. I am guilty of many things, but my deepest sin was unleashing that horror that fateful night. I am convinced the entity will escape its confinement on my death.</p><p>\"Take the box\" - he says, gesturing weakly towards an innocuous metal box on the nightstand beside the bed.</p><p>All the aid I can offer you lies within. You must find the courage to send that thing back to where it came from. You must see that this is done. Do this for me. Please.</p></blockquote><p>As soon as an investigator takes possession of the box, but before they can open it, the ailing Merriweather is choked by a sudden spasm. He doubles up, groans, and then coughs forth a huge gout of blood—spattering any investigator standing near the night stand—then falls into a coma. All of the investigators must make a <strong>Sanity </strong>roll @coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1,sanMin:0,sanReason:Seeing Marriweather cough forth a huge gout of blood—spattering any investigator standing near the night stand.] (0/1 loss—no loss if the roll is successful, but 1 Sanity point lost if failed).</p><p>Would the investigators like to call for a doctor? If they do, the room quickly fills with interns, nurses, and Merriweather’s concerned wife and son. In the way, the investigators are asked to leave by a harried nurse. Despite the hospital’s best efforts, Merriweather dies within the hour.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> why didn’t Merriweather just go back and banish the thing? It’s been over 40 years! While it’s true that he (or one of the other survivors) could have gone back to try and banish the creature trapped in the vacant house, this is an example of a long-term phobia effect on a character. Despite any guilt felt in knowing that it was still there, none of the survivors could bring themselves to go back to that house. Perhaps some of the people concerned actually convinced themselves that the events of that night were exaggerated by their youthful imaginations and locked the incident away in the recesses of their minds.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Contents of the Box </strong></h3><p>The investigators are probably keen to examine the contents of Merriweather’s box. Perhaps they leave the hospital and gather at a coffee shop nearby to collect their thoughts and open the mysterious container.</p><p>Inside the box is a recently written letter; a yellowed envelope containing the deed to a house and the key to its lock; a small, sarcophagus-shaped gold box of ancient design; and a slim journal bound in leather. Each item is detailed as follows:</p><p></p><h4><em>The Deed and Key</em></h4><p>The deed and key concern a farm property on Boone Road, near Ross’s Corners, a village west of Arkham.</p><p></p><h4><em>The Letter</em></h4><p>The letter is from Rupert Merriweather to the investigators (show the players @UUID[JournalEntry.Z4S5T6DiHo2uIiV3]{Letter from Merriweather}). In it, he tries to explain his reasons for asking them to take on such a dangerous task. The letter only serves to confirm that he is terrified of the house and the creature trapped within it, and fears its release upon his death. </p><p></p><h4><em>The Sarcophagus-Shaped Box</em></h4><p>The lid comes off the ornate box easily; however, there is nothing inside. A successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:History,id:URo2NSSJSNdvOqXU]{History}<strong> </strong>or @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Archeology,id:GHhkcJUqjcP4lToY]{Archeology}<strong> </strong>roll identifies the hieroglyphs decorating the outside of the box as Egyptian, of the Middle Kingdom, although those carved on the inside of the lid are distinctly different and not Egyptian at all. A successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Occult,id:6pSfZVS68jSHxa5T]{Occult} roll reveals that the odd carvings on the inside of the box lid resemble writings attributed by certain occultists to the lost Pacific continent of Mu.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: the mysterious carvings on the inner lid of the box are a “red herring” and not important in this adventure, as the investigators have no way to decipher them. However, the box and its carvings are a potential plot point for a future adventure. One of the fun ways to enjoy Call of Cthulhu is to create your own adventures, and the box is left here so that you might devise a scenario focused on it and the hidden meaning of its carvings. Perhaps the box is an important occult artifact and the language is alien? Perhaps some evil group seeks the box and discovers the investigators now possess it? All of these are potential plots, but you can probably come up with your own ideas and look to turn it into a fun adventure for your players at some future point.</p><hr /><p></p><h4><em>The Slim Journal</em></h4><p>Bound in plain leather and held together by cords, the journal is obviously handmade. Its entries date from June 1876 to May 1881. While the ink has faded with age, a <strong>Language (English</strong>) roll is unnecessary to understand it. Reading through the entries requires approximately four hours’ time. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: the journal holds a record of the Dark Brotherhood’s activities at an old farmhouse. When the investigators wish to read its contents, show them <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.oAtnJTAGNbjKC34i]{Slim Journal}</strong>. (After clicking on the \"Show Players\" button in the top right corner you will be prompted to decide who to show it to and if you want to transfer ownership. Ownership should be transferred for items and clues that players should keep, so go ahead and give them ownership of the journal!) The entries were written by Rupert Merriweather, while a final newspaper clipping, dated August 1882, is pasted next to the entry marking Marion Allen’s grisly murder. Reading the volume costs the reader 1D2 Sanity points (deducted from current Sanity), but also adds 1 percentile to the reader’s Cthulhu Mythos skill, as well as granting a skill check in Occult (ask the player concerned to tick the box next to the Occult skill on their sheet).</p><hr /><p>From reading the volume, the investigators find out about a group of friends, all students at Miskatonic University in Arkham, playfully calling themselves the “Dark Brotherhood.” They held their first meeting in the late spring of 1876. Rupert Merriweather was the group’s recording secretary. The members numbered six, including Marion Allen, the founder and their nominal leader.</p><p>In June of 1876, Merriweather purchased a deserted farmhouse outside Ross’s Corners. This was to be a place where they could conduct their experiments in privacy. Representing themselves as a student literary fraternity, they cleaned and furnished the place, while Marion Allen carved special warding (protective) signs over the wooden doors and windows. At the time, the others were amused at such precautions. A series of experiments, innocent and apparently ineffective attempts to contact the spirit world, are then detailed.</p><p></p><h4><em>The Last Entry</em></h4><p><strong>Note</strong>: the last entry is a list of names, supposedly those who belonged to the Dark Brotherhood, followed by a date—presumably the date of each of their deaths. The dates have been written in various inks, but all by the same hand, suggesting that Merriweather made an account of the deaths of his companions over several years.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"NVKNaTZrtzC31cBq","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1JSjNIqMSKLsrfd2.JournalEntryPage.NVKNaTZrtzC31cBq"}}},{"name":"NEXT STEPS","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>By late afternoon, Rupert Merriweather is dead.

It is likely, however, that the climax of the adventure takes place before the younger Merriweather can enlist the aid of an armed sheriff to evict the squatters from his newly acquired farm.

It notes that little is known about the box, although scholars believe it to have been the possession of the little-known Nophru-Ka, a would-be usurper of the Egyptian throne, who lived during the Third Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. The box was believed to have been given to Nophru-Ka by the gods, and was said to contain djinn that could be called upon to enact some form of service.

There is a dense patch of these in front of the house where a flower and vegetable garden once grew. The flowers have spread across the area, but a successful @coc7.check[type:skill:Spot Hidden]{Spot Hidden} roll detects some well-grown vegetables can still be found in the garden plot. </p><p>Inspecting the tall grass and weeds around the house, a successful @coc7.check[type:skill:Spot Hidden]{Spot Hidden} roll finds a recently dead raccoon laying in the knee-high grass. If the thirty-pound (13.6 kg) carcass is turned over, the cause of death is easily determined. The animal’s breast is stained with clotted blood, and a large hole has been bored into its chest. An investigator making a successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Science (Biology)]{Science (Biology)}<strong>, </strong>@coc7.check[type:skill:Medicine]{Medicine}, or @coc7.check[type:skill:Natural World]{Natural World} roll may determine that the animal’s ribs were wrenched apart and then its heart was neatly scooped out. A fox could have done it, but the investigator has an uneasy feeling after noticing the edges of the wound, which are just too smooth to suggest another animal did this.</p><p>A trail leads off from the house to a small privy, still standing and intact among the trees. A decaying barn stands behind the house, as well as a collapsed lean-to where bundles of firewood were once kept. There are still logs present, but these are damp and will need to be dried in the house before they will burn without excess smoke.</p><p>A water well, made from large stones, stands next to the house. The bucket and rope have long rotted away, so need to be replaced. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> the water in the well is safe to drink, though there is forest litter floating on top. The monster lurking in the farmhouse’s attic killed the raccoon.</p><hr /><h3><em>Looking Further Afield</em></h3><p>Investigators who take the time to wander around the grounds of the property and who enter the surrounding woodland may make a grisly discovery. About 200 yards (183 m) from the barn, within the trees, is the body of a middle-aged woman. The investigators may suddenly come upon the corpse if they are searching the area, which provokes a @coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d4,sanMin:1,sanReason:dicovered a body] <strong>Sanity </strong>roll. </p><p>Examining the body, the investigators find that the woman’s clothes are blood soaked and still wet. Closer examination finds a large hole in her chest. If the investigators already found the dead raccoon, the woman’s wound is disconcertingly similar to that found on the animal: her rib cage has been torn apart. A successful<strong> </strong>@coc7.check[type:skill,name:First Aid]{First Aid} or @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Medicine]{Medicine}<strong> </strong>roll reveals that the woman’s heart is missing.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: the unfortunate woman is the missing Maggie McPhirter, who went out after dark to check on her horses and hasn’t been seen since. Reporting Maggie’s death to the police before they explore the rest of the property, or carry out the ritual, may affect some of the events detailed below; it may also make the investigators persons of interest to the local police, which could hamper their activities. The Keeper should adjust what happens accordingly. </p><hr /><h3><em>Searching the Barn</em></h3><p>If an investigator searches through the remains of the barn, request a @coc7.check[type:characteristic,name:dex]{dex} roll to traverse the debris without tripping. A failed roll results in a fall, causing [[/r 1d3]] // [[1d3]] hit points damage from cutting a hand or leg on some broken glass. The remains of several rusted farm tools and horse tack are all there is to find here. There are no animals larger than a rat living in the barn or on the property. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: the monster in the farmhouse’s attic kills most of the animals that come into the area at night.</p><hr /><h3><em>Approaching the Farmhouse</em></h3><p>The remains of a porch swing rest at the edge of the trees that once supported it.

She planted the flower and vegetable garden in front of the house. The bench swing was an anniversary gift Bradley made for her.</p><p>The couple tended their farm for several years, earning enough from their crops to have a good life. In time, Sarah contracted pneumonia, forcing Bradley to take her to Boston for treatment. He put the farm up as collateral for a loan from the bank to cover her medical bills, and this is how he eventually lost the property.

(If they didn’t think to pick up such items, there’s a lantern hanging by the front door, but also call for a @coc7.check[type:attribute,name:lck]{Luck}<strong> </strong>roll to see if they can find a pair of lanterns and some oil and wicks in the barn.) The only light source down in the cellar is a lantern sitting on a shelf across the room, which the investigators may find with a successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Spot Hidden]{Spot Hidden} roll. The good news is that the lantern is full of oil and the wick is still useable.</p><p>The cellar is small and has a low ceiling, making the room feel claustrophobic. The floor is hard-packed earth. It’s cooler than the house above and smells of dirt and dust. There is a pair of chairs against a wall at the base of the steps, and a table with a missing leg resting on its side. Shelves line one wall. Cans and boxes sit on the shelves, each holding the long-spoiled remains of foodstuffs. Several tins of tea leaves lurk among the cans, complete with silver tea set, now long tarnished. There are a few cast iron pots and pans for cooking, and sets of tableware for eating. Additionally, on the lowest shelf, is a row of bottles containing good liquor. </p><p>By the steps leading into the cellar is an old but still sturdy 8-foot (2.5 m) ladder. Behind the steps is a pile of lumber, a bag of rusted nails, and a wooden box with some old tools: hammer, hand saw, hand drill with 3 different bits, chisel, and rasp. In a corner near the shelves is a bundle under an oiled tarpaulin. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: if the tarpaulin is removed, the investigators find an expensive looking travel trunk. The straps are fastened, and latches secured. See The Trunk (following). All of the supplies down here were brought by the Dark Brotherhood, who stocked up for the weekends they spent here.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Trunk</strong></h3><p>If the trunk is opened, the investigators see a folded black cloth, with a handwritten letter resting on top. On the underside lid of the trunk are more warding sigils (carved by Marion Allen). Within the trunk are materials mentioned in Rupert Merriweather’s journal (@UUID[JournalEntry.oAtnJTAGNbjKC34i]{Slim Journal})—listed below. If the investigators read the letter, give them @UUID[JournalEntry.mqYyob5xdCovhGmI]{Handout 5}.</p><ul><li>Six folded black robes.</li><li>Cigar box (see following).</li><li>A sheaf of yellowed papers (see following).</li></ul><h3>Cigar Box</h3><p>The box and brand of cigars date to the 1870s. Once opened, inside is a small metal canister containing a coarse and brownish powder, and a smaller wooden box with a sliding lid. Within the smaller box is a silvery, talcum powder-like substance. </p><p>A successful Science (@coc7.check[type:skill,name:Chemistry]{Chemistry} or @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Pharmacy]{Pharmacy}) roll identifies sulfur and oxide of copper as constituents of the brown powder.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> the brown powder is burned in a fire during the ritual to summon or dispel the monster.</p><hr /><p>The silvery talcum powder defies identification—even if subjected to laboratory analysis. The powdery substance is somewhat like graphite and adheres to the skin, coating it and imparting a greasy feel, but washes off easily. </p><p>Should an investigator make a successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Cthulhu Mythos]{Cthulhu Mythos} roll (highly unlikely due to the fact that the investigators probably have little to zero ability in this special skill) they can identify the silvery talcum powder as the @UUID[.4jOak4lu4dJvcvSC]{POWDER OF IBN-GHAZI}. Note that Dr. Armitage (Orne Library at Miskatonic University), if shown the powder, could identify its true name and purpose. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> the investigators don’t necessarily need to know what the powder is called or even what it actually is in order to use it against the monster in the attic. If necessary, ask for an INT roll to deduce that the powder might be useful against the monster; presumably, if thrown at the monster, it might have some effect. </p><hr /><h3>Sheaf of Yellowed Papers </h3><p>The papers are handwritten notes, all dated from 1877. All the sheets are in Marion Allen’s handwriting. None of the writing mentions the silvery talcum-like powder (Powder of Ibn-Ghazi). Key information contained in the papers is described as follows:</p><p>Six of the sheets of paper are all the same, all of them copies of the same Latin chant (these were prepared as separate copies for each of the members of the Dark Brotherhood)—@UUID[JournalEntry.bgcbteiYPjTfFjUJ.JournalEntryPage.VkJfJU7AbEPJOmim]{Chant}. The phrases are in Latin; a successful <strong>Language (Latin)</strong> roll can translate the text —<strong> </strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.bgcbteiYPjTfFjUJ.JournalEntryPage.cMUGpXLgUhQMbmDK]{Translation of Chant}.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note:</strong> This time we will try something different. Don't show to players the whole Journal with the handout, but show them only one page of it. To do so instead of the eye in the top right corner, right-click on @UUID[JournalEntry.bgcbteiYPjTfFjUJ.JournalEntryPage.VkJfJU7AbEPJOmim]{Latin Chant} in the page list and choose \"Show to players.\" then ask players to make a Language (Latin) check. By going to their Character sheet and clicking the corresponding skill if they have it. If someone pass, only then show them the second page @UUID[JournalEntry.bgcbteiYPjTfFjUJ.JournalEntryPage.cMUGpXLgUhQMbmDK]{Translation of Chant} following this same procedure.</p><hr /><p>One sheet identifies the Latin chant as having been derived from a book called De Vermiis Mysteriis. It also states that, while the original chant detailed the ritual for “releasing the spirit trapped inside the ancient amber,” several words within the incantation have been replaced, changing the original summoning ritual to one of exorcism so that it may be used to dispel the vile spirit currently trapped in the attic.</p><p>One sheet contains a description of a pentagram and says the symbol must be drawn as part of the ritual—<strong> </strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.LucazsWoWEZfCe79]{Handout 8}.</p><p>Three sheets discuss the procedure of the ritual itself, which takes at least an hour to perform and must be started at midnight. While at least one person speaks aloud the ritual phrases, another person must draw the pentagram on the floor, while another burns a certain combination of chemicals in a fire nearby. Allen’s notes mention that the chemicals resemble a brown powder, which he says he has prepared and stored with these papers in a metal canister ready for use. While one person may perform the ritual chant, the notes recommend that several people take part, allowing each individual to occasionally interrupt their chanting without disturbing the overall ritual or its potency. If the chant is continuous, with at least one person reciting the repeating phrases aloud, the “spirit” must succumb; however, it warns that even the slightest disruption of the chanting may result in failure, requiring another ritual to be performed on a following night. The notes suggest that during the ritual, “a watcher be posted, lest the sorcerers be disturbed by the nuisances and distractions of malevolent spirits.” Thus, these sheets confirm that a two-hour ritual using the chant provided, begun at midnight, will drive off unwanted spirits.</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note: </strong>finding the yellowed papers and the old cigar box in the trunk is an important clue, which serves to provide the investigators with a means to dispel the monster lurking in the farmhouse. Without this important information, the investigators will fail in their task to banish the horror. It’s okay if the investigators don’t find the papers initially. Later on, once they realize they are in danger, the Keeper can remind the players that they did not search certain rooms or that they forgot to look in the trunk, and so on. Giving the players a nudge in the right direction without necessarily telling them what to do is fine. Remember, the Keeper provides the information but it’s up to the players to use what they are told. If the Keeper has reminded the players about something they may have missed, but which they then choose to ignore, then on their own heads be it!</p><hr />","markdown":""},"_id":"4hjW6wGD8EvrgChm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.UBbhmplPWdMrAv9A.JournalEntryPage.4hjW6wGD8EvrgChm"}}},{"name":"POWDER OF IBN-GHAZI","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":3},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"example\"><h2>POWDER OF IBN-GHAZI</h2><p>The Powder of Ibn-Ghazi is a rare magical substance, created through specialist arcane knowledge.

However, if the Lurker’s attack kills the investigator outright (they lose all of their hit points from the attack and fall), it indicates that the talons have caught in the investigator’s skull. With a scream, the Lurker hauls up the dangling corpse, rips out its heart, and then throws the carcass back down through the opening. Witnesses to this horror should make a <strong>Sanity </strong>roll @coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d6,sanMin:1]. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: did you notice how each outcome described above provides a different Sanity point loss? As the severity and horror is increased for certain possible outcomes, the Sanity loss is also increased. Only one of the outcomes is possible (the investigator dodges and falls, the monster hits them, or the monster kills them), so only one set of Sanity losses is applied (ignore the outcomes that don’t actually happen). Additionally, investigator death is common in Call of Cthulhu (it’s a horror game after all). Should one of the investigators die, the player concerned can create a new investigator to jump back into the game after a reasonable pause. The new investigator could be another associate of the other players’ investigators—perhaps they run from the house after the death of one of their own and then head back to Ross’s Corners to use a telephone to call for help. Alternatively, the new investigator might be a local person, come by the house when searching for the missing Maggie McPhirter, who becomes embroiled in the adventure. Talk to the players about how the new investigator could arrive, as some of the players are likely to suggest good ideas. Agree the most appropriate, and introduce the new investigator accordingly, dropping them into the action when the time comes.</p><hr /><p><strong>Another Keeper note:</strong> some players may, after the death of an investigator, think to call the police for help. As Keeper, you have a choice: do the police respond or do they ignore the plea? Ask yourself: are the police likely to believe crazy stories of monsters living in attics? Probably not. If the players use some other more believable tactic, a policeman might be sent to the farmhouse to check things out (depending on any previous interactions the investigators may have had with local law enforcement). On investigating, he looks in the attic but is immediately killed by the Lurker. Now, as the investigators have effectively sent an innocent man to his death, they must make another <strong>Sanity </strong>roll @coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d6,sanMin:1,sanReason:innocent man died] for comprehending their role in the death—plus they may have some explaining to do! Another alternative is to have the policeman be the replacement investigator, which puts his actions into the hands of the player—ignore the advice above and don’t automatically kill him off: let him join the investigators and attempt to solve the mystery.</p><hr />","markdown":""},"_id":"WhI3VIch8rsjqMsp","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2000000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.2GKNfrIhfuUqbodT.JournalEntryPage.WhI3VIch8rsjqMsp"}}},{"name":"ABOUT THE LURKER","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>This monster is a near invisible and barely material manifestation from another dimension.

Setting the house ablaze does not harm the creature, but rather encourages it to take up residence nearer to Ross’s Corners!</p><p>Dispelling the monster takes around two hours of continual chanting, begun at midnight. A properly drawn pentagram and a fire burning some of the brown chemical compound found with Allen’s notes are also required. These notes also suggest that at least one person stand back from the ceremony in order to watch for malevolent spirits that may be drawn to the rites, but the investigators may do as they wish.</p><p>To dispel the Lurker, several of the words in the chant have been changed; the altered ritual is in the documents found in the trunk in the cellar (page 38). Individual chanters may stop now and then to catch their breaths, but at least one person must be chanting at any given moment. Each investigator participating in the chant donates 2 magic points every half hour they join in the chant. A total of 8 magic points is required for the ritual to work; thus, if two investigators are chanting non-stop, they will generate enough magic points in one hour, shortening the ritual. If an investigator’s magic points reach zero, deduct further magic point losses directly from their hit points (one for one); the damage this causes can be reflected by cuts opening on the investigator’s skin, bleeding thick, red blood down their clothes and onto the floor. Note that the Lurker will try to prevent the chanting, so some investigators may need to break off to defend themselves or defend the other chanters; thus, it may also take longer than two hours for the investigators to generate the 8 required magic points.</p><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: for a reminder about magic points, see <strong>Step Two: Secondary Attributes</strong>, page 7, in <strong>Book Two</strong>.</p><p><strong>Before the Ritual Begins</strong></p><p>Once the investigators have figured out that they must perform the ritual to banish the monster, they must wait until midnight to begin. Depending on the time that the investigators reach this conclusion, the Lurker may depart the house to seek out food. At sunset, hours before the investigators can begin the ritual, the creature leaves the house. With an ear-piercing shriek, it screams out of the attic and across the fields towards the nearby woods. A Listen roll is unnecessary to hear it exit.

A successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Spot Hidden]{Spot Hidden}<strong> </strong>roll, or if a lantern or flashlight is used (no roll), reveals a middle-aged woman, obviously hurt, making her way to the house. She lifts her head and calls toward the house. Her face is streaked with blood. What do the investigators do?</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: this is the reanimated corpse of the missing Maggie McPhirter. She has been dead for 24 hours, her heart chewed out by the Lurker in the Attic. The monster has spent 5 magic points to animate the body and thereby disrupt the ceremony. If they didn’t find her body during their preliminary searches of the property, then the investigators won’t be aware of who she is (was) until they get a closer look at her, triggering a <strong>Sanity </strong>roll (@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d6,sanMin:1,sanReason:animated body of a woman ]). However, if they do know who she is, they must make a Sanity roll as soon as they see her. Obviously, if the investigators have already reported Maggie’s death to the police and her body has been removed, then the Lurker cannot use her in its attacks.</p><hr /><p>Anyone going outside is attacked, either by @UUID[Actor.90YkPuyyf4Xd7Mqo]{Zombie Maggie Mcphirter} (if present) or, if the Keeper chooses cruelty, by the @UUID[Actor.1ZvcG6zuxTv5sbyc]{The Lurker in the Attic} itself. The Lurker may also animate the corpse of @UUID[Actor.fLYo6s4gncsWSH0u]{Zombie Red Jake} if it managed to kill him, too, using it to attack any investigator attempting to help the woman. If the animated dead fail to lure the investigators out, the Lurker has its puppets assault the house, pushing on the doors or windows, screaming, shouting, hollering, and biting. The undead corpses cannot enter the house because of the wards, but they can throw rocks or branches through windows and at doors, and they can attempt to tear down the wood above windows and doors on which the wards are etched—if the investigators do not stop them from doing this, then the torn down ward is useless and the undead may enter the farmhouse to cause even more mayhem. They are fearsome, but not very difficult to destroy. The Sanity losses they provoke may be their most dangerous aspect. </p><p>The Lurker may also animate animals it has killed to attack the house, or any investigator outside it (costing it 5 magic points per large—bear-size—creature, or 1 magic point for small animals, such as a raccoon or bird). The reanimation lasts for up to 3 hours or until the reanimated corpse is destroyed. Profiles for the reanimated Maggie and Red Jake, as well as a reanimated raccoon and a brown bear can be found in Actors tab under <code>NPC/Monsters</code> folder. These creatures are options for the Keeper to use, if so desired. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: if the Keeper wishes to be really cruel, then the Lurker can adopt a particularly devious strategy. Although the reanimated dead cannot pass Allen’s protective wards while they are intact, the Lurker can, nevertheless, throw the carcasses of those creatures left in the attic down through the hatch and into the house, only bringing them back to “life” once they are passed the wards that would otherwise stop them from gaining entry. This strategy is only recommended if there are four to five well-armed investigators able to deal with these undead furry nemeses. At the very least, it should encourage the investigators to get on with banishing the creature once and for all. </p><hr /><p>Able to generate all manner of odors, the Lurker can lure or disorientate the investigators. It can mimic anything it has experienced, so the smell of fresh baked bread or roasted meats are options to confuse investigators into acting rashly. Remember, the Lurker is able to interact with anything outside the two rooms that are warded in the farmhouse. If the investigators traveled in a car, it can cause the horn to go off, doors to slam, and create general mayhem. Alternatively, it can sit on the car and taunt from outside, and then proceed to tear the automobile apart. A nasty Keeper might have the Lurker leave invisible acidic slime all over the interior of the car—after banishing the monster, the investigators suffer acid damage when they go to leave! (Which can make for a fun scene the morning after.)</p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: why doesn’t the Lurker just go through the walls around the wards? This is a logical question regarding an illogical circumstance. Entities from outside our dimension are subject to magical wards. Sensing these protective energies, they are “put off ” by them. While the wards are placed over windows and doors, they act to seal the entire room. While the Lurker is not powerful enough to cause the earth to tremble and cause the house’s walls to fall down (destroying the wards), some other monsters from the Cthulhu Mythos are. Luckily, for the investigators, such horrors do not feature in this adventure!</p><hr /><p><strong>An option</strong>: the investigators do not need to make skill rolls for performing the ritual, although the Keeper could—optionally, if wanting to add to the tension—decide that certain skill rolls are required. The following are suggestions: an <strong>Art/Craft (Drawing, Art, etc )</strong> or @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Occult]{Occult}<strong> </strong>roll to correctly draw the pentagram on the floor; a @coc7.check[type:characteristic,name:dex]{DEX}<strong> </strong>roll to correctly time the burning of the brown powder; and a @coc7.check[type:characteristic,name:pow]{POW}<strong> </strong>or @coc7.check[type:characteristic,name:con]{CON}<strong> </strong>roll from those reciting the Latin phrases to ensure they maintain the chant. If incorporating these optional skill rolls, allow the investigators to push failed rolls, with the consequence of a pushed failure being that the Lurker’s zombies break through the wards into the room, allowing the monsters to physically menace the proceedings.</p><h3><strong>The Lurker Appears</strong> </h3><p>Nearing the last five minutes of the ritual, a wisp of oily smoke curls down from the ceiling, twisting towards the center of the pentagram on the floor. The creature from the attic is drawn through the wards before the investigators’ eyes. </p><p>At this point, any animated corpses under the Lurker’s control are released and fall lifeless to the ground. Any other effects the Lurker was creating also stop abruptly. Four more minutes of chanting is all that is required to drive it back to its place in the dimension it hails from. As it begins to condense in the pentagram, it becomes partially visible—appearing in the form of someone the investigators know. </p><hr /><p><strong>Keeper note</strong>: when the Lurker appears, it takes the form of a familiar face—ideally, take inspiration from one of the investigators’  <strong>Significant People </strong>in the Backstory section on the reverse of their investigator sheets. Alternatively, it could choose Red Jake, if it hasn’t been able to use his corpse to attack them already. The Lurker appears like this to fool the investigators and tempt them into making a deal (see below). The Keeper has the option of allowing an investigator to make a @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Psychology]{Psychology}<strong> </strong>roll to see through the disguise. Once an investigator dismisses the Lurker’s disguise, it can change form again into another investigator’s Significant Person, if the Keeper desires. Any that dismiss the Lurker’s disguise get to see its real form: a horrible twisting mass of talons and maws and long appendages, which provokes a <strong>Sanity </strong>roll (@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d8,sanMin:1,sanReason:real form of Lurker ]) —but subtract any points already lost when previously observing the Lurker leave the house at sunset. In addition, if any investigator goes insane, they now see the Lurker as a terrified and confused human child, rather than a horrible monster. As an involuntary action, an insane investigator steps forward to embrace and comfort the child. Unless stopped, they could die, as although the monster is confined within the pentagram, it can attack anyone who crosses the symbol’s perimeter. </p><hr /><p>The Lurker, taking the form of someone known to an investigator, can attempt to make deals with the investigators at this point. It can offer information to things they personally seek: locating a missing relative, translation of a rare book, or even arcane lore (5 percentile points in the Cthulhu Mythos skill). These are only some of the things it can tempt or bargain with for its release—the Keeper is invited to create more temptations appropriate to the investigators. The Lurker may be able to grant some of these whispered bribes, but is unlikely to carry through with its promises. In this capacity, it does fit the classic role of djinn-like beings. Do the investigators listen and accept the bribes, or do they continue on and complete Merriweather’s dying wish?</p><p>If an investigator breaks the pentagram on the floor (i.e. causes a break in the drawing), the Lurker is free of the binding and can attack anyone it likes. If the undead have broken in and some investigators are engaged in fighting, call for a <strong>Luck</strong>@coc7.check[type:attribute,name:lck]{don't break the pentagram drawing} roll each round to determine if an investigator in combat has inadvertently stepped on and broken the pentagram. </p><p>If the investigators dismiss the Lurker’s bargaining and finish the last few minutes of the chant, the monster is driven wailing from this world, vowing revenge on the investigators for their deeds. Banished, it leaves only a lingering, unearthly foulness behind.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"iF9xW2Ih0MEutjne","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0McFJVwHZMYfKW7M.JournalEntryPage.iF9xW2Ih0MEutjne"}}},{"name":"CONCLUSION","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Either the investigators successfully banished the Lurker and, more or less, survived the adventure, or they were driven from the farmhouse and fear to return.

This loss results from the knowledge that the Lurker remains free.

You don’t have to use any of the following ideas, and can end the scenario as described above. But, if your players want to continue the game, these ideas serve as possibilities, allowing you to extend the scenario a little, or you could use them to start a new investigation of your own design.</p><ul><li>Do the investigators leave the area without reporting any deaths or the discovery of Maggie McPhirter’s body? Or do they satisfactorily explain to the sheriff what happened? The sheriff will not believe stories of monsters and zombies, so the investigators will need to think up plausible explanations if they do not want to become “persons of interest” in the sheriff ’s eyes.</li><li>Do the investigators benefit from Rupert Merriweather’s will? He considered them fine and trustworthy people; perhaps he rewarded them with a gift from his estate. Options for this include a car for the investigators to drive around in, a collection of books and artifacts, which have some dark connection to the Cthulhu Mythos, or just a key to a post office box that contains pages of mysterious writing and an equally mysterious map with a circled area on it. These last two could drive the investigators into a new scenario, where the artifact, book, or map lead them into another mystery and encounter with a dark cult or monster.</li><li>Who or what murdered Marion Allen all those years ago in New Orleans? Were they cultists desperately searching for the sarcophagus of Nophru-Ka? Could such evil cultists learn that it is now in the investigators’ possession and come looking for it? Looking into the background of Marion Allen, the investigators may find that Allen was briefly affiliated with the Chapel of Contemplation in Boston. Who was the uncle that Marion feared would look for him? The manner of Allen’s death is not dissimilar from what the Lurker did to its victims, but on a much larger scale. The Keeper can decide if it was human agency that inflicted the wounds or if those seeking the gold sarcophagus sent a monster after him.</li><li>And what about the investigators’ jobs? They may have now missed several days of work and need a cover story for their bosses. What flimflam can they come with to pacify their bosses?

Compare the DEX of any investigators involved in the scene with Red Jake’s DEX of 60. The order of who gets to act first is decided in DEX order, highest first. On everyone’s DEX turn, the character gets to do one thing: most likely to attack.</p><p>• Making an attack: roll 1D100 and compare this to the character’s <strong>Fighting </strong>skill to judge if the attack was successful; if so, was it a Regular, Hard, or Extreme success? The defender gets to respond by announcing whether they are attempting to Dodge or Fight Back (<strong>Book Two: Close Combat</strong>, page 18). Usually, the attacker and defender roll their dice at the same time and then compare the results. Whoever wins the combat gets to deal damage. </p><p>• Remember, everyone involved in the combat gets to act on their DEX turn, as well as getting to react (Dodge or Fight Back) against each attack made on them. •If two or more characters are attacking a single opponent, they Outnumber the opponent and may gain a bonus die to their attack roll (<strong>Book Two: Outnumbered</strong>, page 20). •Rather than attack, an investigator could decide to tackle and hold the opponent, using a Fighting Maneuver (<strong>Book Two</strong>, page 19).</p><p>•Alternatively, an investigator might try to reason rather than attack at all. What skill is the investigator using?<strong>Charm, Fast Talk, Persuade, </strong>or<strong> Intimidate</strong>? Their manner and choice of delivery determines which of these skills is used.

The opponent might surrender, turn tail and run away, or pause only to then resume attacking. </p><p>In the case of Red Jake, he surrenders if one of the investigators convinces him they mean him no harm; otherwise, he will defend himself if the investigators decide to attack him.

Fleeing the house in a panic, leaving his meager belongings behind, he was chased down by the monster that inhabits the house.</p><p>His escape was narrow. He fled from the monster, which seemed about to catch and attack him, when it suddenly veered away into the woods behind the barn. Little does Red Jake know that the monster heard Maggie McPhirter and chose to attack her instead, carrying her away to where her body now lies (see Looking Further Afield, page 32). Not quite believing his luck in escaping the monster, Red Jake spent the night shivering and hiding under a tree.</p><p>Eventually building up the courage to reenter the house, Red Jake sneaked back inside to retrieve his belongings, only to be surprised by the arrival of the investigators. He now hides in the dark cellar. Paranoid and fearful, he is temporarily insane from last night’s encounter with the horror. </p><p>A number of possibilities exist for what could happen with Red Jake, as follows:</p><h3><em>If Red Jake is Left Undisturbed</em></h3><p>If left alone, Red Jake waits until the time is right and then bolts upstairs, grabs what he can of his possessions left on the table, and darts out of the back door, heading for the woods. Unless the investigators can run him down, he does not return.</p><p><br />Chase: if trying to catch Red Jake, ask the investigator chasing to make an opposed @coc7.check[type:characteristic,name:dex]{DEX} roll.

If the player wishes, they can attempt another opposed roll until the chase is ended. If Red Jakes wins two consecutive opposed rolls, he manages to get away, but if the investigator wins a single opposed roll then Red Jake has been caught—allowing the investigators to hear his story concerning his encounter with the monster. If you need a reminder about <strong>Opposed Skill Rolls</strong>, see page 14 in <strong>Book Two</strong>.</p><h3><em>If the Investigators Enter the Cellar</em></h3><p>If someone goes downstairs, perhaps investigating the strange noises, Red Jake jumps out of the shadows and makes a surprise attack with an old table leg.

If the investigator failed to spot Jake in the cellar, then add a bonus die to the roll, choosing the best (lowest) result.

A successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Psychology]{Psychology}<strong> </strong>roll determines he is in shock, so if the investigators act to calm him down, they manage to get a few scraps of information from him. Alternatively, a successful @coc7.check[type:skill,name:Psychoanalysis]{Psychoanalysis} roll works to calm Red Jake down enough for him to talk.</p><p>Red Jake describes how he found the house yesterday while traveling through the countryside, and how, during the night, he heard strange sounds and was then attacked by what he calls a “monster.” He says the monster made a piercing shriek as it hunted him in the woods, but that it also created a stench, like rotting meat. He was lucky to get away, as it seemed the monster heard something in the woods and left him alone to go investigate.</p><p>He has been aimlessly traveling up and down the Eastern seaboard since he returned from the Great War. He tells those who listen that he has family in California, who he’s trying to get back to. He’s an honest man by nature but is too undisciplined and impulsive to hold down a regular job. He makes what little money he can by doing handyman chores for those folks that will let him. If the investigators search Red Jake, they find his pockets contain a folded straight razor, a whetstone, a whistle, and 32 cents earned from his last odd job.</p><h3><em>What Happens to Red Jake?</em></h3><p>The investigators could take Red Jake to Ross’s Corners and turn him over to Pa Peters, the Justice of the Peace. With Maggie McPhirter missing (unless her body has been discovered), the police pin her “abduction” on Red Jake and he is arrested to face trial. If the investigators play a role in bringing Maggie McPhirter’s death to the attention of the police, then they save Red Jake from a prison sentence, but may, inadvertently, cause complications for their own investigations. </p><p>If Red Jake runs away and escapes the investigators (or they simply let him go), he dies that night, the second victim of the monster in the attic. He may return after death to pay the investigators a surprise visit (see <strong>Enacting the Ritua</strong>l, page 45).
